            <strong>Hon JOHN CARTER (Minister of Civil Defence)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I wish to make a statement under Standing Order 347 in relation to the state of national emergency in Christchurch City. On Thursday, 31 March I further extended the duration of the state of national emergency in Christchurch City, under section 71 of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act. That was the sixth extension of the state of national emergency that has applied specifically to Christchurch City since it was first declared on 23 February. I will make a further extension tomorrow, Wednesday, 6 April. The extensions are necessary to enable the national controller to continue exercising his powers and functions under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act.</p>

            <strong>CHARLES CHAUVEL (Labour)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I acknowledge the statement from the Minister of Civil Defence. I also, though, record some disappointment, given that on the last occasion when the Minister advised the House of the renewal of the state of emergency, it was pointed out to the Government that the very wide powers under a national state of emergency needed to be questioned as far as their appropriateness for dealing with a regional emergency is concerned. The Minister was asked to address the House, on the next occasion when he spoke to the House on this matter after consideration, about whether a regional state of emergency would do. I note in this regard that the Cabinet papers that have been released concerning the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority contemplate effectively putting in place such a state, to be administered by the new entity to be created by that legislation. Although the Opposition continues to support the need for extraordinary powers to exist in Canterbury, I do register my disappointment that the Minister has not addressed the point of whether a national state of emergency remains necessary in the circumstances.</p>

            <strong>KEITH LOCKE (Green)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> The Greens have supported the national state of emergency as a means of mobilising national resources and getting essential recovery work done quickly and efficiently. We praise the many people who have gone the extra mile to get things moving: the people at Orion, who got the power back on very quickly; the heavy-truck operators who have been working so hard to get all the silt and rubble cleared away; and the many people who have travelled from cities and towns outside of Christchurch to work there and help the people of Christchurch in their hour of need.</p>
          <p class="a">However, alongside the praise, we have to note the criticism by Christchurch locals of certain aspects of the civil defence operation, and help rectify this situation wherever
 the criticism is justified. It is distressing that as recently as this morning we still read in the Christchurch
 <em>Press</em><strong></strong> newspaper that people are complaining that premises are being knocked down without the owners or residents even being informed. In this morning’s
 <em>Press</em><strong></strong> Hayato Sakaguchi, who operated the Billiken Japanese restaurant in Colombo Street and lived in the apartment upstairs, complained that his building had been demolished without notification or any opportunity to recover valuables, despite the fact that he had registered his details on the official www.recovercanterbury.co.nz earthquake website.</p>
          <a name="page_17660"></a>
          <p class="a">The slow, overly cautious, zero-risk approach to giving business owners access to premises is still causing frustration and slowing business recovery. The closer the earthquake recovery operation is to the people, the less we will see such problems. In this respect the quicker the national state of emergency can be ended and more powers can be devolved to the local people, including the Christchurch City Council, the better it will be. Bodies like the newly announced Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority need to be truly accountable to Cantabrians.</p>
          <p class="a">In the Minister of Civil Defence’s statement today he did not really give any idea—and I support what Charles Chauvel said—of when the national state of emergency will be ended, or even what criteria will be used to end it. The Greens have been asking written questions on that matter, and we have not had any real reply.</p>
          <p class="a">The plan for the regeneration of Christchurch, particularly the central business district, needs to be locally driven. Kennedy Graham and the Greens in Christchurch are helping by planning a series of forums to gather ideas for rebuilding the city on a sustainable basis.</p>
          <p class="a">We always need to be mindful of the huge challenges being faced by the people of Christchurch, and of our responsibilities as a nation to help them. Christchurch businesses and workers will need substantial financial support for a long while yet, which is why the Greens are pressing for a national earthquake levy on higher-income earners. We cannot see how the money for that support will be generated to a sufficient amount in any other way. We cannot just say to Christchurch businesses and workers that they will get 3 months worth of income support and then they are on their own or on the dole.</p>
          <p class="a">We do support the extension of the state of emergency, but we would like more information in future. Thank you.</p>

            <strong>Hon JOHN CARTER (Minister of Civil Defence)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I just want to say that it is wonderful when people have 40/40 vision 5 weeks later. The point is that the state of emergency will be continued until we have a replacement. The second thing is that we did endeavour to contact the person the member complained about, but we could not find them and had to make the decisions that we did. Of course, we are always concerned first and foremost about the safety of people. Finally, I just make the point again that the national state of emergency applies specifically to Christchurch City.</p>
