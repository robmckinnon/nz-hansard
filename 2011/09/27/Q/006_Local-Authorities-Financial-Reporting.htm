    <div class="SubsQuestion">
      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>6.</strong>
        <strong>Hon DAVID PARKER (Labour)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Local Government</strong>: Does he stand by his statement “We require councils from the next election onwards to put out a financial report in plain English. … I think if we had had that reporting procedure some years back, we might not have got ourselves into some trouble with councils”, in light of the increase in the gross debt of the Auckland City Council during the mayoralty of John Banks?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:50:31"></a>
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE (Minister of Local Government)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Yes, I do.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: Is the Minister aware that under John Banks, rating increases for the Auckland City Council were held at falsely low levels by the greatest ever increase in debt—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Gerry Brownlee</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. This line of questioning really does cause us, I think, to reflect on your most recent ruling, because there is clearly no point in asking this Minister what he thinks about a mayor’s policy; he has no responsibility for that. If the other question was blatantly trying to get into political point-making, there could be no better example than what we are being given by David Parker at the present time. The question should not be allowed to stand.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.
 </p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I will hear briefly from the Hon David Parker.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: He has not heard the full extent of my question, and it plainly does have ministerial responsibility.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The Speaker has heard sufficient, and the Minister has no responsibility whatsoever for the actions of the Auckland mayor. He has no responsibility whatsoever. The member will recollect that some actual thought went into the primary question to try to get it in order, and I ask the member, likewise, to try to make sure his supplementary questions are in order.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. With due respect, I know what it is in the end of this question, and you do not. I find it extraordinary that you are ruling out a question from a senior member, who has taken some time to construct a question that goes to ministerial responsibility, before you have heard it.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I am certainly not going to remove the question from the member. I ask him to repeat his question, but to please make sure it is in order.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: Is he reinforced in the concern that lay behind his statement given the reality that in New Zealand’s largest city council, Auckland City Council, rates were held at falsely low levels by increasing council debt by the greatest amount ever in New Zealand’s history, from $322 million at 30 June 2008, to
 $1,149
 million at 30 June 2010—an increase of over a billion dollars in 2 years under John Banks?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: No, funnily enough, and the reason is that ahead of the reforms, Treasury functions across the various councils in Auckland were amalgamated, and Auckland City Council took on that role. So it borrowed $416 million, which it then on-lended to other councils, saving them considerable money because we had just one council. The Auckland City Council also borrowed another $215 million on behalf of Metro Water, which the council then on-lended. If that is netted out, we will find that the trend for debt in the Auckland City Council is exactly as predicted. In fact, Auckland City Council, in taking on that function ahead of the amalgamation, saved Auckland ratepayers some considerable money.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: Does the Minister still hold with his other statement that councils “take on debt largely
 without the awareness of ratepayers. They can actually delay the … consequences of that debt for some years, and we are now having to deal with some councils that are being forced to put up rates.”, and does he enjoy the irony
 as much as I do that the worst-ever borrower in the history of local government is now the intended lifesaver for ACT and John Key is telling National voters to vote for him?</p>
      <a name="page_13"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: I do stand by that statement. But, actually, as I said—and the member may not have heard my answer—in the case of Auckland City Council, they were borrowing on behalf of all of Auckland and actually lent the money on, again saving the cost of the additional borrowing for those councils. I would have thought that was a good thing and, in fact, a far-sighted move by mayor John Banks.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: Has the Minister considered allowing councils to fund deficits, like the one created by John Banks, with a tax on cannabis, in keeping with the latest puff of genius from the ACT Party?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: Unfortunately, it is impossible to answer that question without repeating myself, and that shows us the danger of a member preparing his questions ahead of hearing the answers and actually getting caught out with questions that do not bear any resemblance to the Auckland City Council’s final accounts, which showed us that what that member is saying is not true.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: I seek leave to table a document showing that the Auckland City Council’s debt—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The source of the document?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: A concerned ratepayer, drawn from the Auckland City accounts. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: A point of order is being heard.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: I seek leave to table that document showing council debt increasing from $322 million to $1,149 million over that 2 year period, not all of which is—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that document from a concerned ratepayer. Is there any objection? There is objection.</p>
