      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>1.</strong>
        <strong>CLARE CURRAN (Labour—Dunedin South)</strong> to the
 <strong>Chairperson of the Transport and Industrial Relations Committee</strong>:
 Has he requested any written
 submissions
 on the petition of George Laird, signed by nearly 14,000 people, calling on the Government to retain the Hillside and Woburn workshops?</p>
      <a name="page_19"></a>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_15:18:11"></a>
        <strong>DAVID BENNETT (Chairperson of the Transport and Industrial Relations Committee)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> I have not requested any written submissions on this petition.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Clare Curran</strong>: Did he, as chair, put a motion to the committee that a submission be called for from the petitioner or a representative of the petitioner, and did he rule that Michael Woodhouse voted against it?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: This is starting to get into territory that is a matter for the committee. I think that is starting to get into dangerous territory. I will give the member another chance to reword her question, should she wish to.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Clare Curran</strong>: Did he, as chair, put a motion to the committee that a submission be called for from the petitioner or a representative of the petitioner?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>DAVID BENNETT</strong>: What the member may have done as chair is a matter for the committee, and it is not in order to be questioned in the House in that way.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I will seek some advice on this. I may be wrong, but I thought the second supplementary question asked what the chair had done, not what the committee may or may not have done in relation to a matter. I will just seek advice to make sure I am not wrong in allowing that what the chair may have done could possibly be questioned. My understanding is supported by the advice I have just received. The chair cannot be questioned on what the committee may have decided to do with regard to any motion, but if the chair put a motion to the committee, the chair can be questioned on that because that is an action of the chair. I invite Clare Curran to repeat her question, because I think it was in order.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Clare Curran</strong>: Did he, as chair, put a motion to the committee that a submission be called for from the petitioner or a representative of the petitioner?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>DAVID BENNETT</strong>: Any calls for written submissions are for the committee and are a matter for the committee to decide, not the chair. I have not asked for a written submission from that petitioner.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I think you ruled that the question was in order, and the question asked whether the chair put a question to the committee.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: A point of order is being considered. We do not get into debate while a point of order is being considered. I think the point of order is a reasonable point of order. I sought advice on whether the question was in order. The question asked the chair whether he had put a submission—or a motion, was it—to the committee that a submission be called for from the petitioner. I do not believe that that has been answered. The chair has told the House he has not called for submissions, but whether the chair put a motion to the committee is a matter the chair is able to answer, and I believe the question deserves to be answered.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>David Bennett</strong>: The matter is still in front of the committee and any discussions in the committee are held within the committee until the time it is reported back—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Had the question asked what the committee had done and what the committee decided in response to any motion of the committee by the chair, then the chair’s response just now would be perfectly correct and proper—that any decisions of the committee are not matters that the chair is responsible for in this House until the committee reports. But whether the chair puts a motion to the committee is an action of the chair; it is not a decision of the committee. If the chair did something on instruction from the committee, that is another matter, perhaps, but if the chair on the chair’s own initiative put a motion to the committee, it seems to me it is in order for that to be answered, and I do not see the big mystery in answering such a question.</p>
      <a name="page_20"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>David Bennett</strong>: I will have to check that, because I would like to see what was actually said within committee and I do not have that in front of me at the moment.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Far from me it—far from it—I will start again. I am slightly dumbstruck because this is matter on which there have been a series of questions as to whether a particular question relating to a member was—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: If a member claims they cannot recollect, which is what the member is telling the House, I have to, as Speaker, accept the member’s word. The House can make its own judgment about what it thinks, but as Speaker I must accept the chair’s word that he cannot recollect with precision. He obviously wishes to make sure he informs the House correctly and I have to respect that answer. But others can interpret it how they like.</p>
