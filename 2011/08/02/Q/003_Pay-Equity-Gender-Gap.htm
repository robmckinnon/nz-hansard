      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>4.</strong>
        <strong>CATHERINE DELAHUNTY (Green)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Women's Affairs</strong>:
 Does she consider she is doing enough to close the gender pay gap given the Herald Digi-poll today that showed 65 percent of women believed they were paid less because of their gender?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_15:09:21"></a>
        <strong>Hon HEKIA PARATA (Minister of Women's Affairs)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Tēnā koe, Mr Speaker. While the gender pay gap is the lowest it has ever been, at 10.6 percent, there is always more that can be done.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Catherine Delahunty</strong>: Does she agree with 65 percent of women polled by the
 <em>New Zealand Herald</em><strong></strong>, who consider they get paid less than men because of their gender?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon HEKIA PARATA</strong>: As the member knows because we have had a very detailed meeting about this matter, there are numerous causes of the gender pay gap, and therefore there are a range of solutions. I cannot be responsible for the <em>Herald</em><strong></strong>-DigiPoll’s views as they are reported.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Catherine Delahunty</strong>: Does she support allowing women to learn how much their equivalent male colleagues earn by requiring employers to report on gender pay in the workplace?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon HEKIA PARATA</strong>: Again as the member well knows because of the detailed discussion I have had with her, there are already mechanisms under the Equal Pay Act 1972 that provide for an employee who believes they are being discriminated against on the grounds of gender or other things to make a complaint to the Department of Labour, whereupon that complaint can be investigated, including requiring the provision of documents by their employer.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Catherine Delahunty</strong>: Does she consider that the current system whereby women have to take a case against their employer under the Human Rights Act or the Equal Pay Act 1972 is actually working; if so, why?</p>
      <a name="page_15"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon HEKIA PARATA</strong>: As the member knows, we are concerned that, given the underuse of this mechanism, it may not be as well promoted as it could be, and we are working on how we can promote that opportunity to women who may feel they are being discriminated against.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Catherine Delahunty</strong>: How can her suggested solution of career guidance for women deal with the “unconscious bias” of employers against equal pay and pay equity for women?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon HEKIA PARATA</strong>: Sorry, Mr Speaker, can I ask that the question be repeated?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Most certainly the Minister can. Could Catherine Delahunty please repeat her question.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Catherine Delahunty</strong>: How can her suggested solution of career guidance for women deal with the “unconscious bias”—a comment of the Minister—of employers against equal pay and pay equity for women?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon HEKIA PARATA</strong>: In fact, my comment relates to the point I made earlier, and that is there are a number of causes of the gender pay gap. They include occupational segregation whereby half of all men and women are employed in occupations where 70 percent or more of those employed are of the same gender. There is a requirement for greater flexibility in workplaces. We know that the career guidance that is offered to students often results in girls choosing more lower-paid trade options than boys do, so we are working with the Minister of Education to address that. We are focusing on—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Catherine Delahunty</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am sorry but I asked the Minister about dealing with the unconscious bias of employers, and we have not heard anything relating to that, at all.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: If I recollect the—[<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] A point of order has been called. If I recollect the member’s question, she started the question by asking something about guidance for women, and I think the Minister is answering that part of the question.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Catherine Delahunty</strong>:
 Can I repeat the question, Mr Speaker, because the question was about how her solution would deal with the bias of employers?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member cannot expect the Minister to answer the question in exactly the way she might want her to. I think the Minister has answered that question.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Catherine Delahunty</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I asked a question about career guidance dealing with the unconscious bias of the employer. I have not heard an answer on that question.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Well, I am sorry, because I have.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Catherine Delahunty</strong>: Perhaps this is the issue.
 Why is the Government putting the burden on individual women to search for pay information and take action against their employers to solve the system-wide discrimination against women?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon HEKIA PARATA</strong>: I am not sure that the member has any evidence for system-wide discrimination. What we have in New Zealand is three pieces of legislation that together provide the opportunity for men and women alike who feel they are subject to some kind of discrimination to be able, as has been traditional in this constitutional democracy, to pursue their rights.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Carol Beaumont</strong>: What decision has the Minister made on my request that the Government pick up the Pay Equality Bill drafted by the Human Rights Commission, which would provide real mechanisms to address pay inequality?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon HEKIA PARATA</strong>: I am continuing to read the report provided by the human rights commissioner. My officials are studying what the proposal is. The proposal is distinctly different conceptually from the current approach that New Zealand has used for discrimination. It takes some time to consider it.</p>
