    <div class="SubsQuestion">
      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>3.</strong>
        <strong>Dr RUSSEL NORMAN (Co-Leader—Green)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister responsible for Ministerial Services</strong>: Have any of his staff corresponded with the Leader of the Opposition or his staff regarding a 3 News election debate involving all the minor party leaders?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:24:55"></a>
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY (Minister responsible for Ministerial Services)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Yes, one staff member provided the Labour leader’s office with copies of letters sent to media organisations about campaign debates.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Russel Norman</strong>: Were there other verbal communications between his staff—in particular, the Prime Minister’s office staff, but any ministerial staff—and the Leader of the Opposition’s staff regarding this debate; if so, what was the content of those communications?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The Rt Hon Prime Minister.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Simon Power</strong>: No, the Rt Hon Minister of Ministerial Services.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: It is just a courtesy. I could say the Rt Hon John Key.</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I am not aware of all of the communications between my staff, but in terms of ministerial staff acting in a ministerial capacity, to the best of my knowledge there were none.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Russel Norman</strong>: Does he consider it acceptable that his staff—that is, ministerial staff—were involved in working to essentially jack up a presidential-style political debate that suits the big parties in Parliament, which is at the expense of our democracy and our MMP system?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I do not believe that to be an accurate description.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Russel Norman</strong>: Given that there was always going to be a head-to-head debate on TV3 between the Prime Minister and Phil Goff, why is the Government so scared of a debate that would involve—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Simon Power</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I do not believe I need the Acting Leader of the House’s assistance on this. That question is quite out of order. This question relates to the only grounds that the Minister responsible for Ministerial Services can be questioned on and the actions of the staff. The leader of a political party cannot be questioned during question time in the House on why the leader of a political party may or may not have a view about leaders debates. I will give Dr Russel Norman a further opportunity to reword the question. I do not want to deprive him of his supplementary question.</p>
      <a name="page_4"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Russel Norman</strong>: Has he received any advice from his staff as to the fact that there was always going to be a TV3 debate that involved Mr Key and Mr Goff; and why did the staff provide him with advice that he should not engage in a debate that involved all political party leaders?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: In terms of the first bit, yes, I am aware there will be head-to-head debate with the Leader of the Opposition; in terms of the latter point, the member’s assertion is incorrect.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Russel Norman</strong>: Does he get advice from his staff that it is better to appear on lightweight shows like those of Letterman or Tony Veitch, rather than—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Simon Power</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. As I understand it, this matter is a question to the Minister responsible for Ministerial Services. The question that has just been put by the leader of the Green Party would not fit within the ambit of that Minister’s responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Dr Russel Norman</strong>: It is a question on advice that the Minister receives and the nature of that advice. That could apply equally to the Minister—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I believe that the point made by the Acting Leader of the House is valid. The Minister responsible for Ministerial Services did not appear on any of those shows, as far as I am aware, so the member cannot pose a question that way. He is not questioning the Prime Minister; he is questioning the Minister responsible for Ministerial Services.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I think if the question were rephrased as “Did the ministerial staff give any Minister—”.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I am on my feet. The member gave me a probably deserved lecture about me perhaps making commentary that I should not be making, and now under a point of order the shadow Leader of the House has made commentary that perhaps he should not be making, either. Maybe we should score it one all, but we will not carry on down that track. I will give Dr Russel Norman a further chance to reword that supplementary question.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Russel Norman</strong>: Did ministerial staff provide any Ministers with advice that it is better to appear on lightweight shows like
 the Letterman
 show and the Tony Veitch show, rather than on <em>Morning Report</em><strong></strong>, <em>Campbell Live</em><strong></strong>, and an all-party leaders debate where they may face tough questions?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: No, to the best of my knowledge. However, if one were to look at the appearance on the Letterman show, one would see that I did that in my capacity as Minister of Tourism, given that there were millions of people watching that show. In my opinion, that was a good thing to do.</p>
