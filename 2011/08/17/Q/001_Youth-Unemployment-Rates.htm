    <div class="SubsQuestion">
      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>1.</strong>
        <strong>Hon PHIL GOFF (Leader of the Opposition)</strong> to the
 <strong>Prime Minister</strong>: Does he stand by the statement made on his behalf in answer to Oral Question No 4 yesterday that “there is room for celebration in some of this” regarding youth unemployment rates?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:20:22"></a>
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY (Prime Minister)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> I stand by the full statement made on my behalf: “There
 is room for celebration in some of this. For example, Māori youth unemployment rates have gone from 30.3 percent in June 2010 to 24.8 percent now. That is still too high … but we are tracking down. There is a long way to go, but 43,000 new jobs last year—15,000 of them for young people—is a good start.”</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: What is there to celebrate in the June quarter household labour force survey, which shows that nearly 33 percent of teenage Māori are unemployed and that nearly 42 percent of 15 to 19-year-old Pasifika are unemployed? Are these figures not evidence of the total failure of his youth unemployment policies?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: There were a number of things to celebrate in the household labour force survey that was just recently released. We had an unemployment rate that was steady, but we had been creating new jobs. There was also a considerable amount of cash put into Budget 2011 for the creation of jobs; around $55.2 million went into a number of programmes. As the Minister for Social Development and Employment noted yesterday, there actually has been a reduction in the Māori and Pacific youth unemployment rates.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. You will recall that my question specifically asked what there was to celebrate about 33 percent of Māori teenagers
 being unemployed and 42 percent of 15 to 19-year-old Pasifika being unemployed. The Prime Minister ignored commenting on either of those figures.</p>
      <a name="page_7"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: If the member had cut his question at that point, then he would be absolutely right, but he went on to talk about those things being indicative of a failed Government youth policy. The Prime Minister pointed out in his answer why he did not see Government youth policy as having failed. So the remedy is in the hands of the questioner.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Is he celebrating the fact that under his watch as Prime Minister the unemployment rate for 15 to 19-year-old people in New Zealand is at the highest proportion ever since the Great Depression?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: That is a very interesting statement by the Leader of the Opposition. Statistics New Zealand has actually been recording the data since 1986, so not quite back to the Great Depression, I say as a starting point.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: It is true, actually. The member can go and check it out if she wants. The second thing is that yes, the household labour force survey shows that the proportion of people it considers in the 15 to 19-year-old age group to be unemployed is, from New Zealand’s perspective, high at 24.9 percent. But yesterday the Leader of the Opposition came to the House and told us that was the highest rate in the OECD. Let us just for the purposes of clarification run through a few countries that have a higher rate of unemployment than the household labour force survey for 15 to 19-year-olds: Belgium, 35 percent; the Czech Republic, 39 percent; Estonia, 59 percent; Finland, 28 percent; France, 29 percent; Greece, 39 percent; Hungary, 45 percent; Ireland, 46 percent; Italy, 45 percent; Poland, 30 percent; Portugal, 34 percent; the Slovak Republic, 61 percent—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I think the answer has been long enough.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: I seek—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Member</strong>: Apologise!</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: I certainly do not apologise for telling the truth.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Let me just refresh the memories of members. If I have to evict someone today, they will be out for the rest of this week, so we will have a little order. I do not blame the Leader of the Opposition totally then, although he should not have done that. There was obviously an interjection during a point of order, which caused that reaction. But we will not have interjections or any other comments.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: I seek the leave of the House to table some statistics from the Parliamentary Library that go back to 1986 and show that the 27.6 percent unemployment rate for those 15 to 19-year-olds is by far the highest rate we have had since that date and is even much higher than in the dark days of the early 1990s.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that document. Is there any objection? There is no objection.</p>
      <ul class="">
        <li>Document, by leave, laid on the Table of the House.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Does the Prime Minister stand by his claim that 60 percent of the 58,000 New Zealand young people under 24 who are described as not in employment, education, or training are actually at school or at university?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Yes.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: I seek leave to table a document, which is an email from Andrew McLaren of the servicing and analysis team at Statistics New Zealand, saying explicitly that those people are not in employment, education, or training. They cannot be at school or university.</p>
      <a name="page_8"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that document. Is there any objection? There is no objection.</p>
      <ul class="">
        <li>Document, by leave, laid on the Table of the House.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Does the Prime Minister still say that 60 percent of those classified by Statistics New Zealand as not being in employment, education, and training are at school or university?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Yes. The reason for that is that the member will be wrong, like he was wrong yesterday when he came to the House and said the New Zealand teenage unemployment rate had trebled under National’s watch. Actually, it went from 18 percent to 28 percent, so not even by Phil Goff’s maths is that a trebling. It is like when he came to the House yesterday and said the unemployment rate for 15 to 19-year-olds had increased from less than 10 percent when National took office to 28 percent. In fact, it went from 18 percent to 28 percent. It is like he said—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order!</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Well, he—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order!</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: When the Prime Minister just now denied that the number of people aged 18 to 24 on the unemployment benefit had trebled, was the Minister for Social Development and Employment wrong in her answer to written question No.
 6058,
 which shows a 733 percent increase in the number of 18 to 24-year-olds on the unemployment benefit?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I do not have that written question and answer, but I can tell the member that at December 2008 the unemployment rate for teenage people was recorded by the household labour force survey as 18 percent. In June 2011 it was 28 percent, and that is not a trebling.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: I seek leave of the House to table the written question—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: We do not do that. Does the member want to ask a supplementary question?</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: When is the Prime Minister going to front up and admit that his unemployment figures are wrong, that he is conning the public, and that the situation has got worse than it has ever been regarding the proportion of young unemployed people?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Firstly, I do not come to the House like Phil Goff did yesterday and make four or five different errors. I get my numbers right.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Rick Barker</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The member has been asked a question. He has to answer the question, and not just simply relitigate—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I do not believe I need any assistance on this. When a Minister is accused of conning the public in the question that is asked, the questioner can expect to get fair measure back.</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: As I said, the member came to the House yesterday and said the New Zealand Institute reports that the youth unemployment rates in New Zealand are the highest of any developed country. I did not even get through the list; actually, you cut me off, Mr Speaker, because of the amount of time I had spent.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: You are just conning the public, John, and you know it.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Well, let us just, for the purpose of economics, run through a few options. There are three measures of looking at unemployment in New Zealand. The household labour force survey indicates whether a person is looking for 1 hour’s work, and 60 percent of the 15 to 19-year-olds they rang up in that survey were in training, work, school, or, basically, at university.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: That’s not what stats said.</p>
      <a name="page_9"></a>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: It is absolutely correct.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: That is not the figures—</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Well, it is a matter for clarification. The second way of looking at it, is, basically, to look at those who are on an unemployment benefit, and what we know is that in the last 18 months for young people aged 18 to 24 that number has fallen from 23,000 to 16,500. For the record, that was the way that the previous Government used to look at people who were unemployed in New Zealand.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Members</strong>: Get your facts right.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: That interjection was characteristic of the problem I am having as a member of this House. I am being told to get my facts right, but I have in my hand all of the documents from which my comments have been made. I seek leave of the House to table those documents now.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order!</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon PHIL GOFF</strong>: I will do them in order.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I am on my feet, if that has escaped the attention of the member. The member chose to use certain language in his question, and the Prime Minister was somewhat measured in responding. He explained why in his view he was not conning the public: he went back to the basic statistics. I do not believe that the member has anything to complain about in that answer, given the question he asked. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] A point of order is called.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: I seek leave of the House to table a document, which is the New Zealand Institute discussion paper 2011/1, which says that, actually, we have the highest share of unemployment of any youth population in the OECD, which the Prime Minister denied.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Is this the New Zealand Institute of—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: The New Zealand Institute.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that document. Is there any objection? There is no objection.</p>
      <ul class="">
        <li>Document, by leave, laid on the Table of the House.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: I seek leave of the House to table this email from Andrew McLaren of the servicing and analysis team, Statistics New Zealand, which says the 58,000 people were not in employment, education, or training, and had no apparent home duties that required them to stay out of the labour force.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Can I just check that that is not the same document that the member sought to table a while ago?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: No, I asked before, I think, to table a different document, which was the Parliamentary Library statistics.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: No, there was an email—</p>

        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Oh, did I? OK, that is the same document.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I understand that leave has already been granted for that document to be tabled.</p>

 Stop confusing your mates with the unemployment benefit.</p>

        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Are you finished?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I want to hear the question from the Leader of the Opposition.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: How will the $20 million estimated expenditure on youth unemployment that he announced on Sunday be adequate, when Budget 2011 shows that this Government has cut $145.8 million from industry skills training, and when the Minister for Social Development and Employment said most of that money will not go into skills training but go into early childhood services for teenage mums?</p>
      <a name="page_10"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Let me take the first point, which is about the $145 million. That was over multiple years—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: 5 years, actually.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: That is right; 5 years. Thank you for clarifying it, because yesterday the Leader of the Opposition came to the House and said that was an annual number—that is what he said yesterday; $145 million this year, he said yesterday. It all kind of changes depending on which day of the week it is, but that is OK—no big drama. Then No.2—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: You can’t keep conning the whole of New Zealand. You’re wrong on everything you’ve said.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Actually, let us go through the conning bit. Let us understand why a National Government actually reduced that number by $145 million over those 5 years, and what actually happened to that money. That was a scheme run by Labour in 2008, whereby 96,831 people on it did not get one single credit. If they want on that side of the House to spend millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money— [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I think the Prime Minister has made his point perfectly clearly.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Chris Tremain</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. On that particular occasion the Prime Minister had been accused of conning the—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: We are not going to go down that track. I assessed that the Prime Minister had made his point reasonably in response to the question, and that sufficient time had been taken on it. I accept the basis of the point the member was making.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon John Boscawen</strong>: I seek leave of the House to ask a question of the honourable Leader of the Opposition.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I guess it is possible for members to ask questions of members. Leave of the House is sought for that purpose. Is there any objection?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Member</strong>: No.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I trust it is in order, but let me just check with the Clerk to make sure there is no Standing Order against that. Normally a question to a member is to do with the member’s responsibilities, but leave has been granted to the member.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon John Boscawen</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Leader of the Opposition: given that he is so concerned about youth unemployment, what responsibility do he and his colleagues take for the dramatic rise in youth unemployment after youth rates were cancelled, making it illegal for a young person to take a job at less than $13 an hour?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>:
 It is just as well that the question was asked of the Leader of the Opposition, because the Prime Minister does not give answers. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order! Now, I ask members why it was difficult to see me on my feet. There was absolutely no reason to give an answer like that at all, given the question was asked of the Leader of the Opposition. Actually, I should point out that things have changed a bit since the Leader of the Opposition was last a Minister.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon PHIL GOFF</strong>: The answer is that at the time that Labour left office, youth unemployment was a third of the level that it is now. It was at that level because a Labour Government actually invested in skill training for people. A Labour Government created 350,000 new jobs, and a Labour Government reduced the number of people on unemployment benefits to 17,000, and that is a track record I am really proud of. The Prime Minister would do better to halve that.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Chris Tremain</strong>: Supplementary question, Mr Speaker.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: No, no. The House did not grant leave for supplementary questions.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon John Boscawen</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I asked the honourable Leader of the Opposition a specific question. He did not answer that question. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] He was—</p>
      <a name="page_11"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Let me deal with this problem. I say to some members that I have warned them once already. If I evict someone today, they will be out for the rest of this week. Points of order will be heard in silence.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon John Boscawen</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I asked leave of the House to ask a question of the Leader of the Opposition. That leave was granted. I am entitled to have my question answered. The question specifically asked what responsibility the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues take for the dramatic rise in youth unemployment since the minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds was dropped. The Leader of the Opposition pointed to the dramatic rise in youth unemployment. We already know about that. What I am asking is what responsibility he and his colleagues are prepared to take for the dramatic situation that young New Zealanders find themselves in.
 </p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I have heard the member’s point, and in fairness to the Leader of the Opposition he cited figures for unemployed young people, if I recollect correctly, when his Government left office, and he made further comments about the changes in levels of unemployment. In other words, he was in many ways refuting the question of the member, which he is entitled to do in answering a question. I do not believe that I can pull him back any tighter to the question than that.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Chris Tremain</strong>: Supplementary question, Mr Speaker.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: No, there are no supplementary questions. Is this a supplementary question to question No.1 to the Prime Minister? I thought we had moved beyond question No. 1, because the House gave leave for a question to a member. I suppose leave was sought, without my having moved to question No. 2, so I will accept a supplementary question on question No. 1.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Chris Tremain</strong>: How many 15 to 19-year-olds are unemployed now?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Rt Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: This is a good question. If we look at the household labour force survey, we see that there are 26,700 people in the 15 to 19-year-old category. Of those, 60 percent are in school, university, training, or study of some sort, which leaves 15,000 in that category. It is worth making the point that that is 5 percent of the entire number of 15 to 19-year-olds in New Zealand. It is very easy to overstate a problem.</p>
