            <strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON (Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I move,
 <em>That the Whanganui Iwi (Whanganui (Kaitoke) Prison and Northern Part of Whanganui Forest) On-account Settlement Bill be now read a third time</em><strong></strong>. As the introduction to the commentary to the bill says, this is an on-account settlement bill. It is intended to give effect to certain provisions of the deed of on-account settlement relating to the transfer of assets in an on-account settlement of the historic claims of Whanganui iwi. The river and the land claims are yet to be negotiated, although I am hopeful that we will do that very soon, because Whanganui iwi have been waiting for a just and durable settlement of their grievances—particularly in relation to the river—for many years. It is interesting to look at the history of the river claim. It began in about 1887. Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of their case to the Court of Appeal. They desperately deserve a good settlement.</p>
          <a name="page_19991"></a>
          <p class="a">This bill, frankly, should have been passed some months ago. Unfortunately, the Committee of the whole House stage was evidenced by a very disappointing filibuster from Labour, which was probably out of spite for Mrs Turia’s courageous and principled stand on the hated Foreshore and Seabed Act. After this debate, I intend to copy the records of
 <em>Hansard</em><strong></strong> of the Committee stage and send it to Whanganui iwi. They will see just how pointless and empty the Labour contribution to the debate during the Committee stage was. In 9 years Labour managed very few settlements indeed, and all it could do with this on-account bill was filibuster.</p>
          <p class="a">It is interesting that Mr Grant Robertson is in the House, because I know he thinks he is the very apotheosis, as it were, of the art of filibustering because of his little Royal Society bill. The filibustering over that bill is nothing compared with what those members did with this bill. I am very disappointed in Mr Horomia, because he and I always take a bipartisan approach to these negotiations. He is basically a good bloke, but I have to say that the Labour contribution during the Committee stage was pitiful. The bill is very short. As I said, it is an on-account bill. We really must move on, so I commend the bill to the House.</p>

            <strong>Hon PAREKURA HOROMIA (Labour—Ikaroa-Rāwhiti)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Tēnā koe, Mr Assistant Speaker Robertson. Greetings. I rise to speak on the Whanganui Iwi (Whanganui (Kaitoke) Prison and Northern Part of Whanganui Forest) On-account Settlement Bill. I would like to recognise the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations for delaying this bill, but I am certainly encouraged that we have got here tonight and that he is showing a bit of fettle and is going to cut through to the end. I recall that in the 9 years Labour was in Government, we set up 11 settlements that were very close—they just needed a nod and a pat and they would have been finished. The Minister has hardly done any of it.</p>
          <p class="a">In relation to this bill, we are getting to the end, and, certainly in a bipartisan nature, we know how to stick to partnerships and not jump ship like some of the people around here. We certainly are encouraged by those people in the Whanganui area. It really is important to recognise those people, the Southern Whanganui Cluster and Tupoho, and also the effort that Ngāti Apa put in. The Minister has gone; I will talk although he is gone.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (H V Ross Robertson)</strong>: It is not in keeping to mention that someone has left the House. We all have to at some stage or other. I refer the member to Speaker’s ruling 24/8.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon PAREKURA HOROMIA</strong>: Thank you very much for correcting me, Mr Assistant Speaker. The Labour Party is supporting this legislation. It resulted from work begun by the previous Labour Government. I will stretch it out a bit, because a fair bit of this settlement is on behalf and it is pre the agreement between the parties. It is quite a new situation. If this Minister got his act into gear, he could do a whole lot more.</p>
          <p class="a">The bill gives effect to the deed of an on-account settlement that was signed by the Southern Whanganui Cluster / Tupoho working party on behalf of Whanganui iwi. There were tensions, and I say again that Ngāti Apa needs to be recognised for the efforts they put in to allow and to help this to come to a decent end. These are allocations in advance, and there is some peculiarity about allocating the forest, because this forest, standing alone, is held by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. That is surprising. One finds these things out, and they are dug out as the settlement goes along. Certainly the handing over of the ownership of that to the iwi is a wonderful advance. This half-ownership of the land under the Kaitoke Prison is given to the cluster here, and the other half is with Ngāti Apa. I suppose again that Ngāti Apa’s efforts in relation to helping this bill get to where it is today is something that has been recognised.</p>
          <a name="page_19992"></a>
          <p class="a">One of the bigger issues in relation to this settlement—and it has some dynamic relevance to some of the behaviour of people who want to become members of this House—is in relation to putting the “h” in “Whanganui” and the unnecessary debates that went on through some factions that really thought to create tensions between the peoples, Māori and non-Māori, by saying that this was a bastardisation of the language. It was terrible. One person on the radio—one person who went and rolled somebody to become the leader of a party even though he was not a member—seems to be revisiting the nasty notions of scratching that racist itch. It is a wonderful thing, it is a wonderful achievement, that the Crown and these people have come to agreement in relation to putting the “h” into the spelling of “Whanganui” and that the majority of people accept it. It may incite some redneckness here and there, which is something that we can really do without.</p>
          <p class="a">This is a very historic settlement. Apart from the land being settled with those iwi, this language bit in here and the recognition of one culture in this country is a real advance for us. Supporting the “h” in “Whanganui” is a real advance for this country. I was surprised when looking at a map of Whanganui today, which had all these great names. Some of the areas in Whanganui are Springvale, Wembley Park, Castlecliff, Durie Hill, Windsor Park, and Polson Park. This ain’t London; this is Whanganui. The great thing is that somebody saw fit in 1860 or 1870 to transfer these great names from where the kings’ and queens’ horses run around in a park. I have actually been to Windsor Park.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: Have you?</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon PAREKURA HOROMIA</strong>: Yes, I have been there. I have been to Wembley Park, too. I have been to Tolaga Park, too. But the point is this: Māori have had to put up with the renaming of a lot of their traditional areas, and they have accepted it. They have taken the kids down and picnicked at Wembley Park, at Castlecliff, at Windsor Park, and at Springvale—all of these great, British-named places. I see the great Dr Hutchison over there smiling, because he knows this is the truth. All I want is credence given to the Whanganui Māori and recognition that through long, and at times hardy, tribulations, they have seen fit to respect the visitors to this country and recognise their names on a whole lot of areas there.</p>
          <p class="a">So historically today we will support putting the “h” into Whanganui, and we would recognise that one does not play soccer at Wembley Park, and one does not have kings’ and queens’ horses riding around Windsor Park. And what was that other place?</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Hon Mita Ririnui</strong>: Pākaitore.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon PAREKURA HOROMIA</strong>: Pākaitore—that is right.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Hon Mita Ririnui</strong>: That’s a nice English name.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon PAREKURA HOROMIA</strong>: No, it is a great Māori name, Pākaitore. Pākaitore—that is right: Pākaitore, Windsor Park. Pākaitore sounds better—Pākaitore—because it is of the people, it is of the land, and it is of their language. That is the issue relevant to putting the “h” into Whanganui. Do not listen to any of this claptrap about saying it is a waste of time, and that it should not be done. I want to really recognise this bill, and I want to really recognise this legislation, because it is taking us well forward—well forward.</p>
          <p class="a">You see, the Minister was so belittling of my colleague Grant Robertson as to chastise him for trying to create the differentiation between—what is that bill?</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: Royal Society.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon PAREKURA HOROMIA</strong>: The Royal Society of New Zealand Amendment Bill—that is right. These names smack of our English partners; it smacks of royalty. They are great British names, and they are better suited around the city of London, or up the top end of the city where Windsor Park is, but we can live with that, along with
 Whanganui. I commend this bill to the House and I look forward to Whanganui being painted alongside Windsor Park, Wembley Park, Springvale, and Castlecliff—and the name Pākaitore may stand for ever.</p>

            <strong>Hon TAU HENARE (National)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Kia ora, Mr Assistant Speaker Robertson. It is lovely to see you again. I too will say a couple of words in support of the passage of the Whanganui Iwi (Whanganui (Kaitoke) Prison and Northern Part of Whanganui Forest) On-account Settlement Bill. I congratulate the people at home in Whanganui, the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, and the Minister’s staff in the Office of Treaty Settlements on a job well done. I also thank the members of the Māori Affairs Committee, who did a sterling job when we visited Whanganui and heard from the local people. Although there were a few raruraru, I think we will always get that.</p>
          <p class="a">I too use this brief moment in time to comment on the select committee’s recommendation that the word “Wanganui” be changed to “Whanganui” wherever it occurs in the bill—from clause 1, the title of the bill. I will read from the select committee’s commentary on the bill. “We heard from the Southern Whanganui Cluster Working Party that they strongly feel that the spelling of Whanganui should be with an ‘h’. On 18 December 2009, the Minister of Land Information announced his decision to assign the alternative official geographic names ‘Whanganui’ and ‘Wanganui’ and stated his expectation that Crown agencies would adopt the ‘Whanganui’ form over time. We also strongly feel that Whanganui should be spelt with an ‘h’. Accordingly, we recommend amending the spelling of ‘Wanganui (Kaitoke) Prison’ and ‘Northern Part of Wanganui Forest’ to ‘Whanganui (Kaitoke) Prison’ and ‘Northern Part of Whanganui Forest’ throughout the bill with the exception of the reference in clause 4 to the Corrections (Wanganui (Kaitoke) Prison) Notice 2008, but including clause 1, the title clause.”</p>
          <p class="a">It is easy to sidetrack ourselves from the main part of the bill, which is a Treaty settlement, but the recommendation is really interesting and I commend the select committee for it. I also commend the Government, and the House for accepting the recommendation of the select committee. I commend this bill to the House.</p>

            <strong>:</strong>Tēnā koe. Otirā, kia ora tātau i roto i te Whare. Ahakoa kua oti rā te Wiki o te Reo Māori i tērā atu wiki, e tika tonu ana kia kōrerohia tō tātau reo tuatahi o te motu, i ngā wā katoa. Hoi anō rā kai te Kaihautū tēnā koe, tēnā tātau katoa.

          <p class="a">[<em>Thank you. Greetings indeed to everyone in the House. Even though Māori Language Week finished last week, it is very apt that our first language of this country is spoken at all times. So salutations to you, Mr Assistant Speaker Robertson, and to all of us. Yes, I support that sentiment.</em><strong></strong>]</p>
          <p class="a">It is obvious that the Labour Opposition will be supporting the Whanganui Iwi (Whanganui (Kaitoke) Prison and Northern Part of Whanganui Forest) On-account Settlement Bill, and for obvious reasons. Those reasons are that the real work, the really difficult work that is required to bring a proposal like this to the table with all its tentacles intact, is the testing part for any Government. I was a little bemused, shall I say, by the contribution of the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations to the bill, in that he spent something like 80 percent of his time attacking the Labour Opposition in terms of our performance when we were in Government.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Charles Chauvel</strong>: 90 percent.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon MITA RIRINUI</strong>: I stand to be corrected—it was 90 percent of his contribution, and it took only 3 minutes. I think it is very important that at times like these, when these difficult settlement bills come to the House, we acknowledge, in full, the part that all parties play in this level of success.</p>
          <a name="page_19994"></a>
          <p class="a">I was disappointed—I did say I was bemused, but I was disappointed—with his contribution. You see, to get a proposal like this to the table requires a hands-on approach from the Minister. It does not require continual interaction by officials to the point of nausea or to the point where the claimant community becomes absolutely fed up. We learnt that in our time in Government, and that is why under the previous Minister in charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, the then Attorney General, the Hon Dr Michael Cullen, a hands-on approach was required. I think that everyone in this House would agree that once that approach had been taken, Treaty settlements actually accelerated. I have yet to see a settlement bill from this Government introduced to this House that it actually started from the beginning—in other words, where it has actually walked amongst the claimant communities in order to get a buy-in to its policy.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Hon Parekura Horomia</strong>: Paul Quinn’s got through.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon MITA RIRINUI</strong>: I have not seen that happen yet, and I am sure the member across the House, Paul Quinn, of Ngāti Awa descent, is familiar with what I am talking about and what it takes to make settlements a success. It is really necessary also to acknowledge the huge contribution that the negotiating team of Ngāti Apa played in the success of this particular bill. I have praised them in this House on many occasions. They were a young team, they understood the importance of collaboration when it comes to settling Treaty grievances, and they understood the need for collaboration when it came to post-settlement arrangements.</p>
          <p class="a">There are some people in this House who would think that the biggest problem that W’anganui had was the “h” in Whanganui. Well, I do not agree with that at all, but that is an issue that is important to them locally. If that was going to be the silver bullet for the ails of Māoridom, I would put an “h” in Tauranga, but we know it would not fit. The former chair of the Māori Affairs Committee laboured on that point for quite some time—that is, that essentially the major contribution from the Government representatives on the Māori Affairs Committee in relation to this important bill was where the “h” in Whanganui actually fitted. Well, whether or not one puts an “h” in it, I pronounce it the same way: W’anganui, “h” or no “h”. The problem is not my pronunciation; it is actually the English language and the way it spells the word “Wanganui”. But we have all learnt to live with that, as my colleague the Hon Parekura Horomia echoed in this Chamber this evening, and it is time to move on.</p>
          <p class="a">I think everything we need to say about this bill has been said over and over and over again, and it is now time for us to congratulate all of the parties involved and also the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations. Although he has yet to prove himself to be able to be engaged upfront with the claimant communities, it still needs to be acknowledged that this is a major achievement for his portfolio. I am sure that in the future he will have many more challenges to confront as he deals with negotiation groups, particularly from the Bay of Plenty.</p>
          <p class="a">I have no more to say in relation to this bill. It has been a long, long journey for the W’anganui cluster, and I am sure that, along with many of us in the House, they are actually quite pleased that it is over. I notice that this bill was introduced to the House in September 2009. It is now July 2011, so we have to ask why on earth it took so long if it is such a simple bill. It cannot be blamed on filibustering at the Committee stage, because all the Labour Opposition was attempting to have clarified was whether the Government actually understood what was involved in the bill itself. This is an on-account settlement, and we all needed to be clear about what that meant. It was important that at the Committee stage—and this is what the Committee stage is for—we asked all those questions. If the Government or the Minister in the chair cannot answer those same questions, then we will continue to ask them until there is total clarification about what, in this case, “on-account” means for this legislation.</p>
          <a name="page_19995"></a>
          <p class="a">So, as I said earlier on, the Labour Opposition is very proud to support this bill, simply because all the hard work out there in the communities, where the rubber hits the road, was undertaken by the previous Labour Government. Kia ora tātau. Kua oti rā.</p>

            <strong>:</strong> Tēnā koe, Mr Assistant Speaker Robertson. Ngā mihi nui ki a koe. The Green Party has supported this Whanganui Iwi (Whanganui (Kaitoke) Prison and Northern Part of Whanganui Forest) On-account Settlement Bill at every stage until this time, and we will continue to do so tonight.</p>
          <p class="a">I will make a brief contribution to record the basis for our support, because in recent days and weeks an unsavoury element has been creeping into New Zealand politics. It is an element that we reject. The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand stands on our charter, and our charter sets out four principles: ecological wisdom, social responsibility, non-violence, and appropriate decision-making. It also stands on a preamble, and that preamble commits us to honouring the Treaty of Waitangi. For the sake of clarity, it is specific about our intent to honour the Māori wording of Te Tiriti o Waitangi—in other words, the original Treaty that was signed at Waitangi. That Treaty, in our view, provides us with the licence for Pākehā people to live in this country. So for our nation to move forward, we believe that it is important that we go back to that Treaty and that we do our utmost to honour its provisions.</p>
          <p class="a">This bill is about attempting to be honourable about the breach—the disenfranchisement of a people—of that Treaty. For that reason, we support the bill and will continue to vote for it, including at this reading. That is all I have to say.</p>

I understand that this working-group came about so that southern Whanganui subtribes of the Tūpoho district could participate in talks with Ngāti Apa to resolve issues relating to land that they both have an interest in. This bill has interests in the Ngāti Apa settlement, namely the Ngāti Apa (North Island) Claims Settlement Act, which was enacted on 15 December 2010, with a 3 February 2011 settlement date.</em>

            </strong>]</p>
          <p class="a">The Whanganui Iwi (Wanganui (Kaitoke) Prison and Northern Part of Wanganui Forest) On-account Settlement Bill we are debating at this point in time gives effect to the Whanganui iwi deed of on-account settlement, signed between the Crown and the Southern Whanganui Cluster / Tūpoho working party on 31 July 2009. As I said, that was as the result of talks between Ngāti Apa and the working party in order to address concerns that the Whanganui iwi had with aspects of the Ngāti Apa settlement. I expressed the view that it is not for the Māori Party to get involved in iwi politics, which, unfortunately, is one of those things that come with settlements. We do not sit too much in the middle and judge those things, but we certainly provide an opportunity for iwi to have a say. I understood that the working party arose from a need to have a group to represent the interests of Whanganui hapū in the southern or Tūpoho region of the Whanganui district, and to talk directly with Ngāti Apa to work through any overlapping interests that Whanganui iwi had with the Ngāti Apa settlement. Of course, the transfer of those properties is pretty closely linked to the provisions of the Ngāti Apa Claims Settlement Act, which, as I said, was enacted on 15 December 2010, with the settlement date being 3 February this year.</p>
          <p class="a">I acknowledge the iwi who were involved, and the discussion that must have taken place in order to try to find the same way forward, and to address the issues of overlapping claims. That would no doubt have required a spirit of cooperation and communication, as the groups worked together to try to find a way through some of the issues they faced. The on-account settlement bill provides the working party with the right of deferred selection over a half-share in the land under the Whanganui Prison, and the northern half of the Whanganui Forest not offered to Ngāti Apa. The working party’s right of deferred selections over these properties is subject to Ngāti Apa first exercising their right of deferred selection over the forest under the prison, and the southern half of the Whanganui Forest. Should Ngāti Apa or the working party decide not to acquire those assets, they will remain in Crown ownership and may be the subject of discussions in negotiating a comprehensive settlement of the Whanganui iwi historical Treaty claims. Either way, Whanganui iwi interests in these sites will be protected.</p>
          <p class="a">I believe that Ngāti Apa have until early August to take the initial decision on whether to acquire the properties. The on-account settlement is on behalf of, and to benefit, all Whanganui iwi in relation to the Whanganui iwi historical claims. The value of the assets transferred on this on-account settlement will be taken into account when the Crown makes an offer of redress for the final settlement of the Whanganui iwi historical claims. So those claims, and any claims relating to the Whanganui River, are not settled by this on-account settlement. Of course, when we think about Whanganui, we think about Archie Taiaroa—who has since passed on; gee, it must be close to a year now, or maybe a little bit longer than that—as, I suppose, the face or the mouthpiece of
 Whanganui, as they talked about, and continue to move, in respect of settling the Whanganui iwi claim.</p>
          <a name="page_19997"></a>
          <p class="a">I suppose the second on-account settlement is offered to Whanganui iwi. It relates to the transfer of the Whanganui courthouse, with a lease back to the Crown agreed in 2004. This asset was transferred to the Pākaitore Trust, and of course mention has been made of that trust. It is a whenua tōpū trust established under the Māori Land Act, of which Mr Ken Mair is one of the mandated negotiators. He will be taking on Michael Laws in the fight of the century at the end of the year, so I am looking forward to that.</p>
          <p class="a">The Pākaitore Trust is the proposed holding entity to receive the current on-account redress assets. Transferring these assets to the Pākaitore Trust will mean that all assets acquired by Whanganui iwi through on-account settlement will be held by that same entity. The Crown and the working party considered this to be a pretty pragmatic approach under the circumstances.</p>
          <p class="a">That is a bit of a description about a little bit of the history that brought this bill about. It has been a long time coming, but compromise and working together on both sides of the ledger, if you like, in respect of these iwi and a good outcome mean that everyone will benefit.</p>
          <p class="a">Ko tāku noa ake, ko te mihi ki a rātau i whai nei i tēnei o ngā kaupapa kia eke ki tēnei o ngā taumata. Kua tutuki, kua tutuki, kua tutuki pai. Waiho tērā hei mea whakamana mā tēnei o ngā Whare Pāremata. Kia ora tātau katoa.</p>
          <p class="a">[<em>I simply want to acknowledge those who pursued this matter to this level. It has been realised; it has made it; it has been completed well. Leave the bill now for this House of Parliament to enact. Congratulations to us all.</em><strong></strong>]</p>

            <strong>PAUL QUINN (National)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Tēnā koe, Mr Assistant Speaker Robertson. Tēnā koutou e te Whare. Being one who has always been conscious of my limitations and being advised to focus on my strengths I do not want, in my contribution to this debate, to comment on the spelling of “Whanganui” or “Wanganui” because I take my guidance from my relation across the other side and defer to him on matters of tikanga. I thought that I would focus instead in my small contribution to this debate on explaining, firstly, what is happening with this bill, the Whanganui Iwi (Whanganui (Kaitoke) Prison and Northern Part of Whanganui Forest) On-account Settlement Bill. What is actually happening is that having settled the Ngāti Apa claim, just one of many claims that this Government has settled in a very short period—I think it has been something like 16 or 17 claims in 3 years, as opposed to how many in 9 years?</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Chris Tremain</strong>: 16.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>PAUL QUINN</strong>: Sixteen claims in 9 years. We have achieved in 3 years what the previous administration achieved in 9 long years. Having settled the Ngāti Apa claim, part of that settlement had half of the Wanganui Forest going to Ngāti Apa. A cross-claimant to that forest was the Whanganui iwi group, which had a claim to the bottom half of the forest, and similarly with the Whanganui Prison land. Having, if you will, settled the rightful owners to those particular two assets, the Government has taken a very pragmatic step. Because the Whanganui party agreed that in any settlement going forward it wanted those two assets, this Government has got on with the job and given those assets on account, as part of a future full and final settlement. That provides assets, a capability, and a resourcing to those claimants.</p>
          <p class="a">A very big issue in the Treaty settlement process is claimants having resource, and this is one way that this Government has been able to help claimants to negotiate in a position of strength, by providing these resources to them as they move forward in settling their full claim. I think that is a great innovation by this Government, and one that I am sure we will take forward in future settlements. With those few words I commend this bill to the House. Thank you.</p>

            <strong>Hon NANAIA MAHUTA (Labour—Hauraki-Waikato)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Tēnā koe. I too want to make a contribution to the third reading of the Whanganui Iwi (Whanganui (Kaitoke) Prison and Northern Part of Whanganui Forest) On-account Settlement Bill. Unlike members who have spoken before me, who have amply covered much of the detail of the bill, I want to speak in a general nature about some of the learning points from the opportunities provided in this on-account settlement. To understand the full interests of Whanganui and the region, we would have to look at the various component parts of their historical claims. It has been with some interest that I have seen the way in which Whanganui iwi have innovated in their approach to dealing with overlapping interests and the nature of their distinct boundaries within their larger collective group. So the fact that they have an on-account settlement that ensures that Ngāti Apa interests in the south of Whanganui are provided for under this particular bill does not detract from any of the other subsequent interests of other component parts of Whanganui iwi within Whanganui. I think that is a good approach. We have had a number of settlements before the Māori Affairs Committee as I speak that seem, with their own historical peculiarities, unable to resolve some of the overlapping interests, some of the overlapping claims, and some of the contesting of their boundaries. So I think that there is good learning from this particular settlement.</p>
          <p class="a">Can I say that the Treaty settlement redress that has been brought about through subsequent claims, and certainly our understanding as parliamentarians as to how that is all made up, has been supported by the innovation of iwi for dealing with their own complex issues. Again, an on-account settlement is a creative and innovative approach to addressing overlapping interests while not impeding other component parts of an iwi’s claim. We have not seen this type of approach used too often, but it should be a learning opportunity for other iwi who want to pick up the really difficult challenge of advancing their settlements.</p>
          <p class="a">On some of the detail of the bill, the fact that a half-share of the land of Kaitoke Prison will be offered back to Ngāti Apa may present further opportunities for them. Obviously, being a landowner of a prison and a manager of a prison are two different things, but it certainly does present Ngāti Apa with an opportunity on that front. But can I say that I am absolutely sure Ngāti Apa do not want to see more prisons in their region. They probably want to realise any opportunity that gets their people out of prison and into productive parts of our society and contributing to our communities. I say that with a level of confidence because I am sure a lot of people from Whanganui would be happy to see the demise of prisons in their communities and the full utilisation of the skills and expertise of their people, building their people wealth and their economic wealth. Only time will realise whether that is an empty statement or a real aspiration, but it is an opportunity for Ngāti Apa.</p>
          <p class="a">Also, the value of the Whanganui Forest, in terms of Ngāti Apa’s interests in planning for the future, I think presents a real opportunity for Ngāti Apa, too. It will be an accelerant for them to reach their development aspirations.</p>
          <p class="a">We spent some time in the Committee stage debating the issue of Whanganui and including the “h”. We took on board the recommendations of the Māori Affairs Committee. It does not really mean too much to me, with our dialect up in Tainui, because we have always, always referred to Whanganui as Whanganui. Whether or not the “h” was recognised in the word, we have always said Whanganui. The select committee has formalised the appropriate spelling of Whanganui and has amended it in this bill.</p>
          <p class="a">The other part that I wanted to briefly comment on is an issue that was raised by Te Ururoa Flavell, in terms of the other component parts of Whanganui interests, especially with regard to their impending river claim. It seems to me that the opportunity once
 again for Whanganui to continue to advance some larger aspects of their historical claims will add another strong pillar to the ability of Whanganui to plan for the future, to have a vested interest in the protection of their beautiful river, and to contribute to long-term decision-making within their region. I say that with a level of insight, because I have had the honour of being hosted down the Whanganui River, and I know that it is one of special significance and sacred meaning and value to the people of Whanganui.</p>
          <a name="page_19999"></a>
          <p class="a">I note with interest the contribution of the Green member, who said that in this day and age we have moved well beyond some of the views that are starting to rear themselves out in the public domain about Māori getting too much. The resolution of historical injustice is an absolute necessity in order for our nation to move forward, to plan forward, and to ensure that Māori can contribute positively to the shape and identity of the nation that we all want to see, which is the kind of nation where everybody is valued and where historical injustice has been resolved. Sometimes we can never take away the hurt of the past, but working towards resolution, redress, and reconciliation is, I think, a positive way for our nation to go forward.</p>
          <p class="a">All those pillars and elements of resolution are contained within this small bill, and it is important to recognise that, and to not underestimate the value of the transformation that can happen within settlements like this one.</p>
          <p class="a">I thank the Māori Affairs Committee, which considered these issues. As a current member on the select committee I am acutely aware of some of the limitations that we have when it comes to Treaty settlement bills and being unable to significantly comment on the substance of Treaty settlements—but neither would we want to. We do have to continually remind people who are making submissions on bills like this one that the select committee is limited in its capacity in terms of being able to make recommendations of substance that can be enacted by this Parliament. However, if the Māori Affairs Committee is an avenue for casting an eye over some of the substantial matters dealt with in Treaty settlements, looking to some of the technical aspects, and ensuring that the intent of the deed marries up with the articulation of legislation, I think that is a very valuable role for the select committee. I thank the clerks of the committee for their hard work, the advisers to the committee, the officials, and, last but certainly not least, I recognise the negotiators—a young team—of this particular on-account settlement for their wisdom in trying to find a pragmatic solution that is also something that resolves some of their historical hurts and looks to the future.</p>
          <p class="a">Nō reira, Mr Assistant Speaker Robertson, tēnei e mihi atu ki a rātou, nō Ngāti Apa, i raro i ngā whakaaro hei tutuki i tēnei wāhanga mō ā rātou nei kerēme. Tēnā koutou.</p>

            <strong>SIMON BRIDGES (National—Tauranga)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Nanaia Mahuta referred to some of the debates that were held at the Māori Affairs Committee on the Whanganui Iwi (Whanganui (Kaitoke) Prison and Northern Part of Whanganui Forest) On-account Settlement Bill. Many wide-ranging debates were held on whether the “h” should be included in “Wanganui”, and on many other such things. It reminds me of a quote from Winston Churchill, I think it was, who said that if people wanted a long speech from him he could start straight away, but if they wanted a short speech he needed time to prepare. Many of the speeches, as I say, were long and exceptionally wide ranging. I will give a very, very short speech, simply to say that this bill gives effect to the deed of on-account settlement in which the Crown and Wanganui iwi agree to the transfer of assets on-account of the settlement of the Wanganui historical claims. I agree with my colleague Paul Quinn that, really, this bill is a continuation of the very proud record
 National is gaining in settling—and promptly settling—Treaty settlements in this country for the betterment of all New Zealanders, Māori and Pākehā.</p>

Nāna nei i tū ake hei whakahē i te Rōpū Reipa i te mea, nā ngā mahi o tōku hoa a Mita Ririrnui, nāna i whakaritea ngā wāhanga matua o tēnei pire me te on-account<em></em><strong></strong>settlement<em>.
 </em><strong></strong>Ko wēnei wāhanga te pānuitanga kei roto i te Whare Mīere, te Whare Pāremata hei whiriwhiri. Kō wēnei wāhanga te wāhi māmā noa iho, te wāhi ngāwari. Engari, nā Mita, i a te Minita tuarua, nāna nei i whakapau ōna kaha hei ’hakatutuki pai ngā wāhanga tino pakeke. Nā reira, mihi kau ana ki a ia.

          <p class="a">Hiahia hoki ana ahau kia tuku kōrero tautoko mō tērā o ngā mema o te Rōpū Kākāriki, nāna nei i kōrero mō tētahi wāhanga o Aotearoa e āhua kaikiri ana, e kaikiri, e whakahāwea ana i ngā tūmanako o te iwi Māori. Kua ’hakaputa i runga i te pouaka whakaata, i roto i ngā pūrongo niupepa i te wiki kua pahuri ake nei, ngā kōrero ’hakahāwea ētahi ki a ngāi Māori mā, ki a ngāi mātou te iwi Māori. Me te kōrero anō hoki, horekau e whai wāhanga a Aotearoa, wēnei rangi, i wēnā tūmomo kōrero e pā ana ki a mātou. Nā reira, kite ana mātou i taua rōpū e hanga wehewehe ana i nāianei. Ko ia te kai o te mahi kaikiri.
 </p>
          <p class="a">Nā reira, tāku nei akiaki rā i a tātou katoa kei roto i tēnei Whare Mīere, tēnei Whare Pāremata, kia ū tonu, kia hāpaitia i ngā hiahia, ngā wawata o te iwi Māori. Mehemea ka tutuki pai ai ō tātou wawata, ka oti kē, ka tau kē ngā kerēme katoa, ka taea e tātou me tātou katoa o Aotearoa, kia haere whakamua. Tāku e whakapae ake nei, e tū ana a Aotearoa ki runga i ngā pokowhiwhi o ngāi Māori me ngā mahi tūkino ki ō mātou tupuna i ngā tau kua pahure ake nei. Nā reira, horekau ahau e hiahia ana kia kūmea kia roa tēnei tū i te mea, kua roa aianei a Ngāti Apa, ngā iwi o Whanganui, e tatari ana mō tēnei pire ’hakatutuki ai.

          <p class="a">[<em>Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker Robertson. I stand to express my personal views about this bill. I am pleased it has reached its final stage, fulfilling the dreams of Ngāti Apa and those of Whanganui, settling this part of the claim and ensuring that other claims and primary claims can continue. I acknowledge Ngāti Apa and all those who negotiated aspects relating to this bill.</em><strong></strong></p>
          <p class="a">
            <em>I note the references by fellow member Paul Quinn to his weaknesses and his strengths as well, and his wanting to focus solely on his strengths. Consequently he has turned to comment on his elder kin Mita Ririnui. So I endorse those comments about his desire to talk about his strengths—namely, his relative Mita.</em>

            <em>It saddens me somewhat to hear some very minor haggling relating to this bill in the prattle from the Minister. He got up and condemned the Labour Party because of the work by my colleague Mita Ririnui, who arranged some of the main parts of the Whanganui Iwi (Whanganui (Kaitoke) Prison and Northern Part of Whanganui Forest) On-account Settlement Bill. These parts were announced in the Chamber for the House’s consideration, but they were just the easy and straightforward ones. It was Mita, the former Associate Minister in charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, who
 worked hard on the more difficult parts to ensure that they were completed well. So I really acknowledge him.

            <em>I also want to endorse the comments by the member of the Green Party who spoke about someone in New Zealand being somewhat racist towards the aspirations of Māori people. These racist comments, of an offensive nature to Māori generally and to us, the Māori people, appeared on television and in newspapers just a week ago. The member went on to say there was absolutely no place in New Zealand for this sort of talk about us in these days. We perceive that group to be dividing us. That individual will become a victim of his own racism.

            <strong>
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p class="a">
            <em>I urge all of us in this Chamber, in this House, to remain committed to lifting up the wishes and aspirations of the Māori people. If our aspirations are achieved well, all our claims will then be finalised and settled. As a consequence, we and all of New Zealand will be able to move forward together. I praise the fact that New Zealand stands shoulder to shoulder with the Māori people to rectify the injustices our ancestors suffered in years past. I do not wish to prolong this address any more, because Ngāti Apa and the tribes of Whanganui have been waiting a while now for this bill to be settled.</em>
            <strong>
            </strong>]<em></em><strong></strong></p>
          <p class="a">Without wanting to drag this out, I want to just go over a few things I said in Māori. First of all, I acknowledge Paul Quinn, who said that he recognises his weaknesses and his strengths, and that he wanted to talk only about his strengths, so he stood up and spoke about the Hon Mita Ririnui. We can acknowledge that Mita is Paul Quinn’s whanaunga, and I am glad to see that Mr Quinn recognises Mita’s strengths and the work that Mita did on the groundwork around the Whanganui Iwi (Whanganui (Kaitoke) Prison and Northern Part of Whanganui Forest) On-account Settlement Bill.</p>
          <p class="a">It is great that we have come to the stage of the third reading, where this part of Ngāti Apa’s and Whanganui’s settlements can be settled, so that they can go on to settle the rest of their claims. Once all of these claims have been settled—and I am not just talking about Ngāti Apa or Whanganui, but all of the Treaty claims—we can move forward. I think it is important that the country recognises that we have to go through this. We have to settle these claims so that we can move forward. New Zealand is built, basically, by standing on the shoulders of Māori, and on their sacrifices and on what was done to our ancestors over the last 150 years. There is no place in this House or in New Zealand for the sorts of divisive politics we have seen over the last few days. I agree with our colleague Kevin Hague from the Green Party when he mentioned this issue. As a country we cannot afford to engage in this petty divisiveness where we pit one sector of New Zealand against another, because we then have factions on the extremes that basically feed off each other. They give each other oxygen to survive. We cannot have extremism in any field in New Zealand, because there is no constructive use for it. We as New Zealanders need to come together to get these claims settled, so that we can move forward as a nation.</p>
          <p class="a">On that point, again I would like to acknowledge the work of the likes of Mita Ririnui, of the Minister—despite the fact that he spent 90 percent of his 3-minute speech criticising us—and of the Māori Affairs Committee, of which I was privileged to be a member, although I was demoted to the Education and Science Committee, unfortunately. I would like to just acknowledge the work that everyone has done in getting this bill into the House and through the House. Hopefully we can go on to settle all of the other claims, as I said, so that New Zealand can move forward as a country—as two peoples, I will say, with one sense of purpose going forward. I will always say that I was born Māori first, but I am still proud to be a New Zealander. With those final words, Mr Assistant Speaker, huri rauna i tō tātou Whare, tēnā koutou, tēna koutou, kia ora mai anō tātou .</p>
