    <a name="DocumentReference"></a><p>[Uncorrected transcript—subject to correction and further editing.]</p>
    <div class="SubsQuestion">
      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>9. Hon RUTH DYSON (Labour—Port Hills)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister for Food Safety</strong>: What consultation did she undertake with her ministerial colleagues before she announced a proposal to defer the mandatory addition of folic acid to bread?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:49:33"></a>
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON (Minister for Food Safety)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> The proposal to put out a discussion paper including the option of deferral was discussed with ministerial colleagues last week and was considered at Cabinet on Monday.</p>
      <a name="page_8"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: Did the Minister consult the Minister of Finance; if so, what did he say about the $400,000 per year per person currently spent on health care supporting a person with spina bifida—money that could be saved or spent elsewhere if bread were fortified?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: The member outlines the benefits of folic acid for women before they become pregnant and in relation to neural tube defects; I think those benefits are known. But I remind the member, as I did yesterday, that Ireland has a voluntary fortification scheme, which has resulted in a 30 percent increase in folate in that population. It was voluntary; it did not have to be mandatory.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Darren Hughes</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Hon Ruth Dyson asked a question that started by asking what consultation the Minister had undertaken with the Minister of Finance. The Minister, in her reply, went nowhere near answering the question about the consultation she had undertaken.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I think there was more than just that pure question in the honourable member’s question to the Minister. If it had just asked what consultation the Minister had with the Minister of Finance on this matter, then it would have been a different matter. I believe I heard the member go on to raise further issues. If I am mistaken, I will invite the honourable member to correct me.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: The end of the question asked about the cost of health care, and the beginning of the question asked what consultation she had with the Minister of Finance on that issue. It was even more specific than the senior whip indicated.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The Minister can choose to answer either part of the question, and I believe she answered the second part of the question by talking about the kinds of costs involved in this issue. The member has further supplementary questions.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Michael Woodhouse</strong>: Why is the Government putting out a discussion document on the addition of folic acid to bread?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: We are giving New Zealanders a chance to put forward their views on this important matter. Labour did not listen to New Zealanders 2 years ago, and today it seems it is still refusing to do so. We understand that New Zealanders want choice, and we are providing this opportunity for them to have their say.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Ashraf Choudhary</strong>: Why did the Minister tell the House yesterday that no decision had been made, when the Prime Minister said that it was 99.9 percent certain that the fortification was not going ahead and that the Government was “just
 working through the legal niceties”? Does not this statement show the consultation is a sham? Who is telling the truth: the Prime Minister or the Minister?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: We have always maintained that deferral of the commencement date of the standard is our preferred option. We have also made it clear that we have made no predetermination. Following consultation an appropriate decision will be made.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: Did the Minister consult the Minister of Justice on the number of abortions that would be prevented if bread was fortified, estimated to be between 20 and 30 babies every year—babies who would be saved if her decision was different?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: There will be proper consultation at the end of the submission period, and no doubt the figures that have been put forward by that member will be included in those submissions. Following the closing day of the discussion paper we will give full and proper consideration to the submissions.</p>
