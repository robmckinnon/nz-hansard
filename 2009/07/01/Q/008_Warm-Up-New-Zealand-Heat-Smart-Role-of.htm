        <strong>8.
 </strong>
        <strong>NICKY WAGNER (National)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Energy and Resources</strong>: What role will councils play in the delivery of the Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart home insulation scheme announced in Budget 2009?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:54:35"></a>
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE (Minister of Energy and Resources)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Local councils can play an important role in delivering the scheme, by allowing residents to pay off insulation and clean heat improvements on their rates bills. I announced today that the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council has joined the scheme, and Environment Canterbury
 and Nelson City Council intend to expand their current schemes to more suitably accommodate the programme Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart. This is just the start. I am advised that a number of other councils are in the process of working through their long-term plans and other administrative and technical details, so that they, too, can implement plans that will be of use to their ratepayers and enable more people to take advantage of this extremely good Government scheme.</p>
      <a name="page_14"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Nicky Wagner</strong>: How will the Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart scheme help the economy?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: I am advised that over the next 4 years the Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart scheme will create about 2,000 jobs. I will give an example of how that happens. I was out in the Hutt Valley today, accompanied by
 MetiriaTurei from the Green Party, which has been very instrumental in putting this programme together, and we looked at the first house that is being insulated under this programme. The important thing is that the firm that is putting the insulation in place and installing the clean heat, which in this case is a heat pump appliance, has recently employed an additional 20 people and is in the market for even more. The most important thing is that nine of the people employed, from that group of 20, were previously unemployed. I was very impressed that when I spoke to one of the young men today who was doing that work, he said it was good to be doing something that is good for New Zealand. I agree with him.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Charles Chauvel</strong>: Has the Minister seen the comments from the chairperson of the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, the council that he announced was joining the scheme today, who said that as a result of the cuts in grants for clean heating under the new scheme, that council will have to reduce the size and scrap the interest-free component of its loans to ratepayers; and does he now understand that in his haste to replace Labour’s previous scheme, he is making sure that some householders are actually worse off than they would have been?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: No. I do not agree with that. I inform that member that the Hawke’s Bay gentleman who made the comment has been made aware of the situation that has led him to make what is, effectively, a comment in error. Formerly, ratepayers there could get a $1,400 grant, but he had not factored in that the Government has added the $500 heating appliance grant, which means that they can now get $1,800 for actual improvements to their heating. Although that comment from the chair was in the early press statement, I think there will be ones to follow that make it very clear that the residents of Hawke’s Bay are better off under the National Government scheme, which was put together in conjunction with the Green Party.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Nicky Wagner</strong>: What has been the response from the public to the Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart scheme?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: The response has been almost incredible. Before I came to the House I noted that there had been just over 1,200 calls today to the EnergyWise call centre. There have been 143 unique visitors to the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority website since the Budget announcement.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon David Cunliffe</strong>: 143? Ha, ha!</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: I am pleased that the member has picked up on that number. I meant to say 143,000 unique visitors. That is 143,000 New Zealanders who have said what a great job the National Party and the Green Party have done in putting up this programme, how wonderful it is that they can finally heat their house, and what a surprise it is that the politicians are doing something rather just talking about it. For 9 years the previous Labour Government was just talking about it, and in 9 months or less the National Party has put this scheme in place.</p>
      <a name="page_15"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Darren Hughes</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. We were happy to help the Minister to correct his own answer, but I think subjecting us to a Wednesday speech half an hour ahead of time is a bit much.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I accept the honourable member’s point, but the members on the opposite side of the House did interject and provoke a response. I take it the honourable Minister has finished his answer?</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: My apologies, Mr Speaker. I always assume that there are people on the other side of the House who are prepared to learn. In essence, the answer to the question is that there has been a very positive response from the public.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is a very simple point of order. The Minister commented on your ruling in a way that he is not allowed to do.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: In fairness, I think that the whole exchange was in pretty good humour. I do not think that we should get too concerned about that.</p>
