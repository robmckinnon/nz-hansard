      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>7.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon RUTH DYSON (Labour—Port Hills)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister for Food Safety</strong>: What scientific evidence is she using to support any decision to defer the mandatory addition of folic acid in bread as planned under the joint trans-Tasman food standards?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:39:15"></a>
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON (Minister for Food Safety)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> No such decision has yet been made. Deferring the commencement date is our preferred option, but it is certainly not predetermined. We have made a decision to ask the public of New Zealand what they want. The member will be aware that a discussion document is being released tomorrow. It includes the options of the status quo, revocation, and deferring the commencement date to allow for a considered review. I will be making a decision after considering all the submissions.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: Does she agree with the Prime Minister’s chief scientific adviser, Professor Peter Gluckman, that because of a lack of folate—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I apologise to the honourable member, but again I cannot hear the supplementary question the member is asking. How can I assess whether the question is being answered if I cannot hear it?</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: Does she agree with the Prime Minister’s chief scientific adviser, Professor Peter Gluckman, that because of a lack of folate in the diet of pregnant women, there were many cases of neural tube defects resulting in abortion and in babies being born dead?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: I think the benefits of added folate in one’s diet are actually known, but can I remind the member that Ireland has a voluntary fortification scheme, which has resulted in a 30 percent increase in folate in that population. It was voluntary; it did not have to be mandatory.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I ask both sides of the House to please be reasonable. I realise that today is the first day back, and it is always going to be a bit noisier, but I do need to be able to hear.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Paul Hutchison</strong>: What reports has the Minister seen about the mandatory fortification of bread with folic acid?</p>
      <a name="page_10"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: I have seen a report from Annette King calling the standard a “triumph
 for humanity and common sense”, and one from Phil Goff last week stating: “The public is rightly concerned. Let’s get a review. Let’s get the information out and to the public. Let’s make an informed decision about it, and let’s do it without waiting till they bring it in. It needs action now. You know, if I didn’t know any better I’d say ‘Well, what the hell are we doing?’ ”. Finally, I saw on Sunday a press release from Ruth Dyson stating: “Deferring
 the introduction is a cheap cop out.”</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Ashraf Choudhary</strong>: Does the Minister agree with Professor Gluckman that there is no causal link between folic acid intake at the proposed levels under the food standards, and increased rates of cancer in humans?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: I am aware that there is scientific evidence that does indicate it is safe. I have always maintained that I am not a fan of the standard, and that I support New Zealanders being able to choose whether their bread has folic acid—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I realise that this issue creates some emotive involvement, but I want to be able to hear the Minister. The question that was asked was a dead straight question—whether the Minister believed the evidence of the chief scientific advisor—and I think the House ought to be interested in the answer to it. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] I do not know who interjected on me then, but I would appreciate it if they did not do it further. The Hon Kate Wilkinson may start her answer again if she wishes.</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: We are not ignoring the advice of the chief scientific advisor. The safety of folic acid is not the only issue here; the Government understands that New Zealanders want choice, and that is something I do not need to consult a scientist about.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Sue Kedgley</strong>: Why did the Minister repeatedly claim that New Zealand could not possibly get out of a joint trans-Tasman standard on folic acid fortification, when in fact New Zealand opted out of the joint standard some years ago and issued its own separate standard under the New Zealand Food Act to fortify bread, not flour as the Australians are proposing to
 do?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: Our advice was that the window of opportunity to opt out of the standard actually ended 2 years ago, in September 2007. The issue has always been about finding a workable solution, a workable way to work through the process without jeopardising our food treaty obligations.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: Does the Minister agree with Mr Lyall Thurston of the Coalition of Parents of Children with Spina Bifida, who said that
 commercial interests had prevailed over
 public health in her decision to defer fortification of bread?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: I repeat that the benefits of folic acid are well-known but—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I apologise to the Minister. I ask the front-bench members on both sides to please show a little courtesy to those members who are asking and answering questions. I am sure the House cannot hear the answer that the Minister is giving. I apologise to the Minister, and ask her to please answer the question.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: The benefits of the addition of folic acid to women’s diets before they are pregnant are well-known. But we must look at the example of Ireland, where voluntary fortification of bread with folic acid resulted in a 30 percent increase in the uptake. It did not have to be mandatory.</p>
