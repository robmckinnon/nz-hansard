    <div class="SubsQuestion">
      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>12.
 </strong>
        <strong>SUE MORONEY (Labour)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Labour</strong>: Does she stand by her statement to the Transport and Industrial Relations Committee at the estimates hearing for Vote Labour on Thursday, 25 June, that she decided to close the pay and employment equity unit because “it had completed its work”?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_15:03:12"></a>
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON (Minister of Labour)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Yes. The pay and employment equity unit was established in 2004 with a 5-year plan of action. It has been 5 years, and the plan of action has been carried out. Sixty-five reviews were completed, and the research and resources remain available, but a broader approach is still required to close the 12 percent gender gap.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Sue Moroney</strong>: Is the Minister aware, then, that her Government stopped pay equity investigations for 24,000 school support staff and for social workers that were being supported by the unit, and that the unit has yet to complete pay equity reviews for thousands of staff at 15 polytechnics, Te Wānanga o Aotearoa, the Waitakere City Council, HortResearch, one university, and the Teachers Council?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: The member should be well aware that the investigations were of staff in the Public Service and came under the responsibility of the Minister of State Services. The member should direct her questions to the relevant Minister.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Amy Adams</strong>: What should people do if they are paid less for doing the same work for their gender?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: They should provide that information to the authorities so that unscrupulous employers can be prosecuted. The law is clear: people cannot be discriminated against because of their gender. The standard is equal pay for equal work. If Labour members have evidence that women are being paid less only because they are women, as those members claim, they need to bring that evidence forward. It is a breach of the Equal Pay Act 1972, which was enacted by a National Government, and the Human Rights Act 1993, also enacted by a National Government.</p>
      <a name="page_4722"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Darien Fenton</strong>: Why did the Minister’s Government take credit for the work of the pay and employment equity unit in the presentation to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) this month, without disclosing that she had just closed the unit down and the Government had scrapped its ongoing pay investigations?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: That member should have more information; she is incorrect. The Government reported to the ILO on the work that had been undertaken in the past year, as required. And can I say to that member that if equality or equity is of such concern to the member opposite, why did Sue Moroney not replace Moana Mackey on the select committee, who asked no questions whatsoever in relation to this issue—no questions whatsoever?
 And Sue Moroney was not even there!</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The Minister has no responsibility for whether a member asked questions at a select committee. That is out of order.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Darren Hughes</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I say, just to support your ruling, that the member also made reference to the absence of a member from a select committee, which is completely out of order, quite apart from it not being correct in the context of her question. She should have to withdraw that reference to a member, which was unparliamentary.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>:
 Speaking to the point of order—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I have not called the Minister. I will ask the Minister, though: did you make reference to the absence of a member from a committee? [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] You did? I therefore ask—</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>: But the reference—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order!</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Gerry Brownlee</strong>: She’s trying to clarify.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: It is very simple; there is no clarification required. A Minister may not refer to the absence of a member. If the member did do that—</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon KATE WILKINSON</strong>:
 I made no reference to the absence of a member on the select committee. She was in the select committee room, but she was not on the select committee.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Darren Hughes</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Let me deal with this matter first. I warn the Minister that she does not make statements to the House without my asking her to do so. I asked her a moment ago whether she had referred to the absence of a member, and she said she did; now she is saying she did not.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I think the explanation is relatively simple, and the Minister got close to it at the end of her statement. The member was not a member of the select committee, and therefore she could not ask questions; she was sitting in the public area, listening to the Minister’s responses.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I have heard sufficient. The Minister should not refer to questions being asked or not asked by Opposition members. They are not her responsibility.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Sue Moroney</strong>: I seek leave to table the document
 <em>Pay
 </em><strong></strong><em>and Employment Equity Reviews</em><strong></strong>, which outlines the several reviews that have not yet been completed by the unit closed down by the Minister.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Sorry, I missed where the document is from.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Sue Moroney</strong>: It is called
 <em>Pay and Employment Equity Reviews</em><strong></strong>. It details the reviews that have not been completed by the pay and employment equity unit.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Who prepared the report?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Sue Moroney</strong>: It came from the Minister’s office.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table a document from the Minister’s office. Is there any objection to that course of action? There is none.</p>
      <a name="page_4723"></a>
      <ul class="">
        <li>Document, by leave, laid on the Table of the House.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Pete Hodgson</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I respectfully suggest that you take a close look at the video of question No. 12 and draw your conclusions accordingly. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] Do you want me to spell it out?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I have dealt with question No. 12. Forgive me, but I do not know what the honourable member is talking about.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Darien Fenton</strong>: I seek leave to table page 22 of the 9 June 2009 report of the ILO committee on gender equality, where the New Zealand Government says that gender equality and non-discrimination must be at the core of decent work.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that document from the ILO. Is there any objection to that? There is no objection.</p>
