            <strong>Hon TONY RYALL (Minister of Health)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I wish to make a ministerial statement under Standing Order 347(1) relating to AH1N1, the swine flu. I undertook to keep the House informed of any significant changes.</p>
          <p class="a">Reflecting the wide community transmission of the flu, on Friday New Zealand moved from a containment approach to managing the epidemic. This is in line with World Health Organization recommendations. This means that New Zealand is now treating this new flu like the usual seasonal flu. As a result of the tremendous efforts of our public health authorities and primary-care professionals, New Zealand has delayed the likely peak of the swine flu beyond the annual flu peak. As of today, 12 of the 21 district health board areas are in the “manage it” phase, with a further four district health boards expected to enter this phase by the weekend. The decisions to transition to that phase are made by regional medical officers of health and the Ministry of Health.</p>
          <p class="a">Over the coming months, the AH1N1 flu will present challenges to the health system and the community. I have been advised that this flu will become very widespread. The number of confirmed cases has grown by one-fifth overnight. This rate of spread will put pressure on hospital emergency departments and general practitioner clinics, in particular. For example, there may well be lengthier delays in emergency departments, and some surgery may need to be deferred because of the pressure on hospital beds and staff. District health boards will be establishing flu centres as appropriate. It is even more essential now than it was previously that Kiwi families take simple precautions to prevent the spread of the flu, and we are making information on how to do this widely available. Businesses, schools, and other organisations should have contingency plans for more people being away sick than usual, so that normal life can go on.</p>
          <p class="a">In light of health officials’ advice, we are now using the national Tamiflu stockpile strategically. This is because, in nearly all cases, the flu is mild, and it is wise to conserve our stockpile for a possible second wave of a more serious nature.</p>
          <p class="a">I conclude by reinforcing that although the flu will become very widespread—that is expected—it is mild, and we have the resources, plans, and health professionals to deal with it.</p>

            <strong>Hon RUTH DYSON (Labour—Port Hills)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> First of all I acknowledge the Minister of Health and his statement. I thank him for ensuring that all parties have had an ongoing opportunity for briefings on this issue from officials. That openness is appreciated. I acknowledge also the huge additional workload that is being carried by those working within our health system, and thank them for the work that they have been doing.</p>
          <p class="a">I reflect on those who have contracted swine flu. For some, it has been very mild, but for others, it has been extremely serious. I am sure that all members of this House wish everyone with swine flu a speedy recovery. Many others have suffered financially due to schools and businesses closing, and for some that additional financial burden is very hard to bear. I reinforce the message from the Minister: we all need to continue to take simple precautions to prevent the spread of this flu. The change in status may be confusing for some people, and I am pleased to be part of sending what I hope will be a
 unanimous message from this Parliament this afternoon to continue to encourage everyone to do everything we can to prevent the spread of swine flu. Thank you.</p>

            <strong>KEVIN HAGUE (Green)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> When I previously spoke in this House in response to the Minister of Health’s first statement on AH1N1, I indicated my belief that it was unlikely that this virus would be contained, expressed the Green Party’s best wishes to all those affected by the epidemic, and offered the Green Party’s assistance and support for measures to help manage it. In light of the Minister’s statement today and of recent events, it is appropriate to reiterate the appeals for calm that we all made on that occasion and at the same time remind New Zealanders of the need for vigilance. Although the severity of illness associated with this virus is generally mild to moderate, we need to brace ourselves for the reality that at least serious illness will be experienced by a significant number of our citizens and that the disruption will be considerable. Any steps that can be taken to slow the epidemic in New Zealand will be of tremendous value in the long term.</p>
          <p class="a">The Green Party is very pleased to see the new restriction being placed on the use of Tamiflu. We have been concerned for some time about New Zealand’s experiment in having this medicine available over the counter and hope that we will now see the drug’s use aimed at minimising the development of resistant strains, as well as maximising our supply to prepare for future need. I add our voice in praise of the herculean efforts by officials from the Ministry of Health, district health boards, and throughout the health sector to slow the onset of this epidemic phase. Their work has been extraordinary, and a great many New Zealanders owe them a debt of gratitude. Recently, I inadvertently overheard two officials from a district health board commenting on how their organisation had coped with AH1N1. They concluded that there was a sense of calm and control because the pandemic preparedness planning process undertaken over the past several years had prepared the organisation for what it would need to do. So I take this opportunity to extend acknowledgment and gratitude to the previous Government for steering that process.</p>
          <p class="a">It is inevitable that at some point the world will experience a pandemic that causes substantial loss of life in New Zealand. It is critical that even as we implement our previously laid plans to cope with AH1N1, we commit ourselves today to keeping a critical eye on what we can learn to ensure that next time our response is better still. The Green Party applauds the measures that the Government has taken, and offers our continued support for this considered and well-judged response.</p>

            <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE (Leader—ACT)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I rise on behalf of the ACT Party to thank the Minister of Health for keeping Parliament completely informed of the Government’s response, but more particularly to thank the Minister for keeping the public of New Zealand informed of what is a very difficult and potentially scary development, and for what I believe to be a very intelligent, measured, and considered response to this flu. Yes, a lot of work was done by the previous Government in preparing New Zealand and the health authorities for this situation, but the Minister has been at the forefront, and I think his job could not have been done better by anyone in this House. I commend the Minister for that.</p>

            <a name="time_14:39:57"></a>
            <strong>Hon TARIANA TURIA (Co-Leader—Māori Party)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> The Māori Party stands in support of the Minister of Health and his statement bringing attention to the need for caution and collective care in our response to any influenza-like illness. We endorse the comments of the Minister that this is a time when we must all take full responsibility to ensure that people are informed of the symptoms and the risk factors associated with the disease. We have a particular concern as it relates to Māori. We know from accumulated research that Māori already experience higher rates of illness from respiratory conditions. On top of that, the evidence points to the fact that socio-economic
 deprivation increases the likelihood of poor outcomes and respiratory disease. When over 56 percent of Māori are located in three of the most deprived socio-economic deciles, it makes for particular concern that we must be vigilant in our care of each other.</p>
          <a name="page_4493"></a>
          <p class="a">The
 Māori Party believes that it is critical that we all step up to the mark in respect of taking care of each other and taking preventive care of our whānau. The current situation really gives us all the more reason to take all the necessary precautions to maintain good health. We must be alert to the vulnerability of our neighbours, our whānau, and our communities. This is about taking a common-sense approach: staying home when sick, and protecting the life around us. I commend the previous Labour Government for putting in place the pandemic programme, and I say thank you to the Minister for the way in which he has approached this issue, and ensuring that everybody has been kept informed, including the public of New Zealand.</p>

          <p class="Speech">
            <a name="time_14:41:48"></a>
            <strong>Hon PETER DUNNE (Leader—United Future)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I thank the Minister of Health for his statement to the House, updating us on developments of the pandemic as they emerge. I also acknowledge the work of the previous Government in getting us to the state of preparedness where the plans now being implemented were able to be adopted quickly.</p>
          <p class="a">I think we are entering a particularly dangerous phase with this pandemic, especially if reports are correct in stating that up to half of the population may acquire this virus without being aware that it has done so. In that eventuality, a number of the precautionary steps that are being proposed will be more difficult for people to take if they are not aware in the first place that they are suffering from this particular virus. I think the prudence that has been adopted in recent times has been very beneficial in terms of New Zealanders not overreacting, but reacting properly to the emergence and spread of this virus.</p>
          <p class="a">There will be challenges in the future. I put this proposition to the Minister: in terms of some of our larger institutions—our schools and our hospitals, in particular—the Government may need to become more activist in terms of ensuring that those institutions have good sanitary materials and physical equipment available, and that the message about washing hands and keeping clean is delivered. I think that many people want to do the right thing, but they are unsure about how to go about it. Maybe, as this virus moves to its next phase, that sort of practical information and practical advice is something that needs to be considered by the authorities.</p>
          <p class="a">I conclude by simply acknowledging the work that has been done. This is a difficult time for all New Zealanders, and I congratulate the Minister on the prudent way in which he and his officials have handled the situation thus far.</p>

            <strong>Hon TONY RYALL (Minister of Health)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I thank members for their, I think, well-deserved praise of our public health authorities and the work they are doing. I also advise Minister Dunne that the Ministry of Health is sending materials to schools to assist them in their messaging for young New Zealanders. In Victoria, schools have proven to be the main area of spread, and that is why so much effort is going into communicating with schools as to what we can do with our kids in order to help to prevent the flu. Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
