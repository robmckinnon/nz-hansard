        <strong>2.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon PHIL GOFF (Leader of the Opposition)</strong> to the
 <strong>Prime Minister</strong>:
 Does he have confidence in all his Ministers?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:06:58"></a>
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY (Prime Minister)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Yes.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: When did the Prime Minister lose confidence in Dr Worth as a Minister?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Last Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Why, having been given information on Tuesday of last week, did the Prime Minister wait a week before requiring the resignation of Dr Worth?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Because anyone is entitled to natural justice. There was a process to work through, and information to be reached. It took some days to get that information. I had finally received the full information, as I needed it, by Monday. I accepted the resignation of Dr Worth when I had that information.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Why did the Prime Minister lose confidence in Dr Worth?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I am not at liberty to go through all the conversations, but I have made it quite clear that I set the standards, and I expect those standards to be met. If they are not met, then people will not enjoy my confidence, and they therefore will not be in my ministry.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Why did the Prime Minister attempt to keep the reasons for the resignation secret this morning?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: The police are going to conduct a preliminary investigation, as they noted in a press release they issued. I think any New Zealander is entitled to a fair investigation. I do not think it would be appropriate for me to contaminate that investigation by making loose comments.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: What is the nature of the police complaint again Dr Worth?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I am not at liberty to say.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Was Dr Worth meeting the high standards that Mr Key, on becoming Prime Minister, had said he expected of Ministers, before the complaint that has caused his resignation?</p>
      <a name="page_3"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: To the best of my knowledge, yes. There have been instances where Dr Worth could have improved his performance. I pointed that out to him in relation to the India Trade Group. There was another incident that the member will be aware of. I investigated it and was satisfied that there were no questions to answer.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Why was the Prime Minister so indecisive in removing Dr Worth, when under his one-strike policy he could have done it months ago?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Because I am a fair person and I believe in natural justice. When I found the information—[<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] Well, the member might laugh, but everyone is entitled to at least have me get to the bottom of the facts. It took a few days to do that, then I acted. I could point to other Prime Ministers who took a lot longer to act.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: I seek leave to table a statement made by Mr Key this morning in which he advised us that this was a private matter and he would not be making further comment on it. That was before the press conference—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat when I call him to order. He has sought leave to table a press release of today. That is hardly consistent with what the Standing Orders Committee called for in terms of the tabling of documents. The press statement clearly is available to all members today, and does not need to be tabled in this House to improve the information available to members. However, leave has been sought to table that press release. Is there any objection to it being tabled? There is.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr
 Russel Norman</strong>: Is the Prime Minister confident that all the appointments made by Richard Worth as Minister were made openly and transparently, including, in particular, the appointments of five corporate lawyers, including one from Dr Worth’s old firm, Simpson
 Grierson, to oversee the Government’s rewrite of the overseas investment regulations?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Yes, because in the case that the member has raised all five lawyers appointed to the Overseas Investment Commission were expert lawyers. I do not think the fact that one of them came from a firm where Dr Worth had worked some 10 years ago would preclude him or her from being on the commission.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr
 Russel Norman</strong>: Is the Prime Minister confident that Dr Worth’s appointment of these five corporate lawyers to oversee the rewrite of the Overseas Investment Act was all above board, especially considering that the appointments were made 5 days before the review was publicly announced?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Yes. I note to the member that they are providing advice to the Government, which will ultimately go on to make a decision.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Dr
 Russel Norman</strong>: I seek leave to table a letter from Dr Worth making the appointments 5 days before the public announcement was made that the review was under way.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that document. Is there any objection? There is no objection.</p>
