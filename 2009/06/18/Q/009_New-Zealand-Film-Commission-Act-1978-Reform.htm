        <strong>9.
 </strong>
        <strong>LOUISE UPSTON (National—Taupō)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage</strong>:
 What is the Government doing now to fulfil its election promise to update the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978? [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Bill English</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. You dealt with that matter just before, in the way that you chose to deal with it. While the question was being asked Mr Mallard, who is on a bit of a personal crusade against one of the members on this side of the House, interjected consistently throughout the question. Generally, what promotes order in the House is that members have their say on whether a matter is orderly or disorderly, the matter is dealt with, and we move on. But a continuous barrage of interjections during the asking of a question is not acceptable.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I wish to apologise. I was provoked by the waving of fingers, once again.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: We do not need to spend any further time on this. The honourable Minister was about to answer the question.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Bill English</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Labour members have broadcast widely that they intend to target Minister Bennett. We have now seen the third example of that member using the process of the House on matters that are nothing to do with order, in order to continue to make an allegation that a member of the House has denied. The practice in the House is that when a member gets up and says something did not happen, his or her word is accepted. Although Opposition members are going on about fairness, the fact is that that member has now been permitted three times to make an allegation that has been denied, and he has been using and abusing the order of the House in order to do so. We do not intend to accommodate this campaign of persecution that Labour is setting out on, and the House should not either, because it is out of order.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I was not pursuing the original allegation. The member did it again while Louise Upston was asking her question.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Members, I accept responsibility for mishandling the issue formerly. I got the issue wrong, and I have apologised for that. I think it is in the interests of the House that we take a breath and just get on with the business. That is
 why I ruled that we would move on to the next question, and I would like to do that now. The Hon Chris Finlayson is to answer the question.</p>

        <a name="time_15:08:59"></a>
        <strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON (Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Today the Government is announcing a review of the Film Commission. The film industry has moved on significantly since the New Zealand Film Commission Act was passed and the Film Commission was established by the late Allan Highet in 1978. New Zealand now produces a broad range of films, from <em>Black Sheep</em><strong></strong> to <em>Whale Rider</em><strong></strong> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em><strong></strong>. I am very pleased to announce the review will be led by Peter Jackson. He will be assisted by David Court, who is the director of the Australian Film Television and Radio School centre for screen business.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Louise Upston</strong>: Why has the Government selected Peter Jackson to review the Act?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON</strong>: Peter Jackson, who is a great New Zealander, is our greatest film director and producer. He brings to the review unrivalled experience and expertise, including an intimate knowledge of the film-making process from beginning to end. His films have encompassed the full spectrum, from low-budget films such as <em>Braindead</em><strong></strong> and <em>Meet the Feebles</em><strong></strong>, to artistic movies like <em>Heavenly Creatures</em><strong></strong>, through to global blockbusters such as <em>King Kong</em><strong></strong> and
 <em>The Lord of the Rings</em><strong></strong> trilogy<em> .
 </em><strong></strong>I can think of no one who is better placed to conduct this review.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Todd McClay</strong>: What other reports has he seen about the New Zealand Film Commission?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon CHRISTOPHER FINLAYSON</strong>: I have seen a letter that was sent to the chair of the Film Commission asking for a meeting to discuss film issues, which concludes “I look forward to hearing from you on behalf of your sector, organisation, or personal commitment to the arts, culture and heritage.” The literary community will be surprised to hear that this masterpiece was sent by Steve
 Chadwick.</p>
