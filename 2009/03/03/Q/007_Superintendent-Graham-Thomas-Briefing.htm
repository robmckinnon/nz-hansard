      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>7.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon CLAYTON COSGROVE (Labour—Waimakariri)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Police</strong>: Was she briefed on the issues surrounding allegations in respect of Superintendent Graham Thomas; if so, what was the date and content of the briefing?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:38:30"></a>
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS (Minister of Police)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Yes; I was verbally briefed by police on 27 December 2008. I was informed that there had been an incident involving a senior member of the police, and that it was being investigated. I was later advised that, in accordance with the requirements of the police code of conduct, once it became clear there was insufficient evidence to proceed with a criminal case of drink-driving, police moved swiftly to institute employment-related processes.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Clayton Cosgrove</strong>: Has the Minister received an assurance that the correct procedure was followed in respect of investigating this matter, so as to ensure that the officer in question was treated no differently from the way any member of the public would be; if so, does she accept that assurance?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: The police have made it very plain to me that they are following procedures absolutely to the book in all matters in relation to this.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Clayton Cosgrove</strong>: How could she accept an assurance that correct procedures were followed to ensure that the officer in question was treated no differently from any member of the public, when police human resources manager Wayne Annan has stated publicly that specific information about the incident would not be provided because it “does
 not exist”? That quote comes from the<em> Herald on Sunday</em><strong></strong> of 1 March, this year.</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: I note for the member’s benefit that departmental responses to Official Information Act requests are the responsibility of the police. I am advised that the police answered the specific questions from the journalists correctly, but that does not mean to say that the police answered them to the extent that perhaps they should have.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Clayton Cosgrove</strong>: Does the Minister not accept that she has a duty to assure the public that proper processes have been followed in respect of this police officer, who as national prosecution manager is responsible for decisions to prosecute members of the public; or is the best assurance she can give New Zealanders the one she gave to journalists as late as a few hours ago when she said: “This is not a good look.”?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: I actually agree with Mr Cosgrove when he stated—as he was quoted today in the
 <em>Dominion Post</em><strong></strong>—that continuing speculation about the case damaged public trust in police and undermined their good work. Certainly I know that
 he will have the opportunity tomorrow during the select committee process to make more detailed questions available to the Commissioner of Police, because this is actually an employment matter that the Commissioner of Police may be able to answer.</p>
      <a name="page_10"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Clayton Cosgrove</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I do not quite know where that answer was going. I asked the Minister, as per your rulings, a specific question. I asked her whether she accepts that it is her duty to take a number of actions in this case to reassure the public. In no way did she even address or answer that question. Was it her duty?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Gerry Brownlee</strong>: Mr Speaker, when you read the
 <em>Hansard
 </em><strong></strong>you will find that the Minister actually said she agreed with Mr Cosgrove’s comments about the need to reassure the public. Now, surely that is a clear answer to his particular question.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Clayton Cosgrove</strong>: I think that was an own goal. I did not ask the Minister whether she agreed with me. I asked the Minister whether she expects that she has a duty to reassure the public—not whether she agrees with me or any other member of the House. It was a specific question: does she accept she has a duty?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I have heard sufficient.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Gerry Brownlee</strong>: Mr Cosgrove’s statements were in fact about reassuring the public, and I am sure that when the public hear Mr Cosgrove speak, as they often do, they are greatly reassured by their choice last November.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: This is quite a difficult question because there are constraints around what the Minister can say in respect of this matter, as there are issues of privacy in employment matters, etc., as the Minister has explained. However, I invite the member to repeat his question in respect of assurances to the public, and I will listen. I want to satisfy myself that I have heard the question properly, and then I will let the Minister answer it.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. During the last point of order, some comments were made to you by the Hon Gerry Brownlee. I think that if they had been made in the frivolous and facetious way they were by someone on this side of the House, we would have been admonished. You did not admonish him.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I obviously did not hear it. I thank the member for his attention. I did not pick up on what he is concerned about and therefore I could not take action. I have invited the honourable member to repeat his question. Let us listen to it very carefully, and then the Minister, where she can, will answer it.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Clayton Cosgrove</strong>: Does she not accept that she has a duty to reassure the public that proper processes have been followed in respect of this police officer who, as the national prosecution manager, is responsible for decisions to prosecute members of the public; or is the best assurance she can give the one she gave journalists as late as a few hours ago today, when she said: “This is not a good look.”?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: I have already answered that question. I have said that it is important—and I have said that the police commissioner has assured me that processes have been completely followed according to the book. If the member did not remember that answer, I am quite happy to provide it again. Police have given me those assurances. I think it is very important that the public have confidence in the police, and I am surprised that that member keeps wanting to undermine them all the time.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Clayton Cosgrove</strong>: Is her silence on this matter—[<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member has a right to ask his question.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Clayton Cosgrove</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Is her silence on this matter over the last week as a result of advice that she has received from the Minister of Corrections on how not to handle employment matters?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: Obviously I cannot have been silent, otherwise that member could not have quoted me.</p>
