    <div class="SubsQuestion">
      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>1. Dr RUSSEL NORMAN (Co-Leader—Green)</strong> to the
 <strong>Prime Minister</strong>: Does he agree with the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, that: “By tackling climate change head-on we can solve many of our current troubles, including the threat of global recession”; if so, how will he respond to the Secretary-General’s call for a Green New Deal?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:02:01"></a>
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY (Prime Minister)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Yes, I do agree with Ban Ki-moon that the world must tackle climate change, and that New Zealand must play its part, but I am of the view that in terms of tackling the global recession, and given the size and severity of that recession, it will take much more than just good climate change policy.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Russel Norman</strong>: Why did he tell <em>Investigate</em><strong></strong> magazine that maybe the climate sceptics are right, and does he accept the scientific evidence of human-induced climate change—yes or no?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Yes, I do agree that human-induced climate change is real, and I simply pointed out—if the member wants to go and read the whole quote—that it is quite important that countries have flexibility in their climate change legislation. The reason is that one needs to be adaptable as the science firms up, and be able to tackle the new issues as they come along.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Charles Chauvel</strong>: Is the Prime Minister concerned that in appearing to continue to call into question international science on climate change, as he does in this month’s
 <em>Investigate
 </em><strong></strong>magazine, he will cause reputable groups other than Greenpeace to follow Greenpeace’s example yesterday and withdraw from participation in the emissions trading scheme select committee process?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: Firstly, if Greenpeace does not want to come along and give a submission to the special select committee on climate change, I say that is its loss. Secondly, I would assume that someone who is very interested in climate change can also read and would go on and read the full quote, which stated: “But
 at this stage I think it would be irresponsible of us not to play our part when it comes to climate change,”.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Russel Norman</strong>: Does he agree with the Australian Treasury’s conclusion that taking a “wait and see” approach to climate change, which does not seem too far from what the Prime Minister is proposing, will make our economy suffer in the long term as global investment flows go elsewhere. In other words: “If we snooze we’re
 gonna lose.”?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: We are not taking a “wait and see” approach. We are putting together a select committee and charging it with the responsibility of coming up with the right response to climate change, and making sure there is balance between our environmental responsibilities and our economic opportunities. But if any party wants to take responsibility for snoozing and losing, it would be the Labour Party, which, for 8 years, talked a big gain when it came to climate change and actually delivered zippo. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member has a right to ask a question.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr
 Russel Norman</strong>: Is the Prime Minister confident that the commitment he expressed just now to addressing both the climate crisis and the economic crisis is shared across his Government, in light of his Minister of Finance’s statement to the Finance and Expenditure Committee last week that “I think one crisis at a time might just do most Governments.”?</p>
      <a name="page_2"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: One would expect the Minister of Finance to be primarily focused on the global recession, because it is a very significant issue. That is what he is doing, and what a fine job he is doing of placing New Zealand in the best position that is possible. From the Government’s point of view, the member can rest assured that it is taking a serious view when it comes to climate change, but it will have a balanced response.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr
 Russel Norman</strong>: Has the Prime Minister had a conversation with the Minister of Tourism about the Government’s own research that shows New Zealand’s clean and green reputation is worth more than $1 billion per year in export earnings; if so, will he make the kind of Green New Deal investments needed to protect that clean and green reputation, such as riparian planting, and fencing off streams and rivers?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I can assure the member that the Prime Minister often has conversations with the Minister of Tourism. He finds him to be all ears and quite enthusiastic in his ideas. What I can say is that anyone who is engaged in tourism will understand the importance of the environment when it comes to New Zealand and promoting it. I think all New Zealanders do, and they take pride that we are an environmentally friendly country that wants to preserve our environment. That is one of the reasons the Minister of Tourism is very keen on a cycleway from Kaitāia to Bluff.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr
 Russel Norman</strong>: What are the—[<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member’s question must be heard.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr
 Russel Norman</strong>: What are the Government’s contingencies in the event that New Zealand’s $1 billion clean and green reputation collapses under the pressure of the previous years of inaction, which the Prime Minister has referred to, and what would be our perception of the lack of action at the moment, with the result being that our exports suffer? What is the Government’s contingency to deal with that risk to the New Zealand economy?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: The contingency is that the Government is going to work aggressively on producing a balanced response to environmental responsibilities and our economic issues. The member also needs to recognise that probably the biggest single risk to countries taking climate change policies seriously is the global recession. The leaders I have talked to, I can assure the member, are so focused on the recession that they are not particularly focused on climate change at the moment.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>John Boscawen</strong>: Does the Prime Minister agree that the first priority is to review the cost and benefits to New Zealand of any policy action on climate change, and what is the Government’s timetable for completing such work?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I can confirm that that was part of the confidence and supply agreement with the ACT Party, and that that will be occurring. I am not sure about the time frame needed to complete that work, but work will be done to ensure that we have a sense of the issue.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr
 Russel Norman</strong>: Does the Prime Minister agree that the Australian Treasury report, which is probably one of the most extensive studies that has been done so far, showed that the major cost to our economy will be if we do not take action quickly and hard—if we do not act hard and fast on climate change, then we will suffer economic costs and consequences as a result—and that the major risk to us will be if we do not take action quickly enough?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: It is my view that we have to take action, but we also have to take the right action. If the member’s inference, by using the term “hard”, is that we should simply tackle the issue of climate change with no reflection on the impact on our economy, I think that is unacceptable. I do not think the New Zealand public would support a position where our only focus was one of solving the problem of greenhouse gas emissions, and to hell with their jobs.</p>
