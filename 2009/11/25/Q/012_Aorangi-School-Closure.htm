    <div class="SubsQuestion">
      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>12.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon LIANNE DALZIEL (Labour—Christchurch East)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Education</strong>: Why did she not ensure that the Aorangi School board was given time to inform teachers and parents of the confirmation of her decision to close the school before the announcement was made public?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:53:35"></a>
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY (Minister of Education)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Under the Education Act the decision to close a school is made by the Minister of Education. The Ministry of Education communicated my decision to the chairman of Aorangi School yesterday afternoon. I thought it necessary to notify and explain my decision to the community directly and immediately.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Lianne Dalziel</strong>: Is she aware that two of the four schools in the 1.5 kilometre radius of Aorangi School have enrolment schemes that exclude almost all Aorangi School students; if so, why did she allow a misleading impression to be created that there are more options for these children than there are?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: Because there will be one fewer school in the area and the enrolment schemes will have to be redone. I informed the board of that quite some time ago.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Lianne Dalziel</strong>: Did she follow the ministry’s advice to discuss her final decision with the Hon Dr Pita Sharples, an Associate Minister of Education; if so, when did she do that and what was his response?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: I informed Dr Pita Sharples of my decision yesterday afternoon.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Rahui Katene</strong>: How does she respond to the statement from Aorangi School principal, Stephanie Thompson that closing the school sent a clear message that the National-led Government did not believe that a low socio-economic, multicultural part of Christchurch was as important as other groups, and what specific provision will be made for the whānau affected by the closure of the only bilingual unit in the north-east of Christchurch?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: There are two parts to that question. With regard to the first part, I absolutely reject the offensive suggestion that the decision to close Aorangi School was based in any way on the economic and cultural elements of the area. The reasons have always been the cost of the rebuild, the roll’s size, and the number of schools in close proximity. With regard to the second part of the question, I have stated a number of times that I am committed to ensuring that there is an ongoing provision for bilingual education in the area. I have directed the Ministry of Education to work with Ngāi Tahu and local boards of trustees on this very important decision.</p>
      <a name="page_15"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Dr Russel Norman</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Minister appeared to be reading the answer to that question. I wonder whether she was reading from the official document.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I ask the Minister whether she is reading from official documents. The Minister indicates that it is not an official document.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Lianne Dalziel</strong>: Has she or her ministry advised the principal and board of trustees of Waimairi School and Fendalton Open Air School that their zones will be altered as a result of this decision?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: The decision to close Aorangi School was made and announced yesterday. A change-manager is being appointed as soon as possible by the Ministry of Education, and he or she will be in contact with all the surrounding schools. I say to the member that the children who attend Aorangi School come from quite a wide section of Christchurch, so it is impossible to tell at this stage how many children will be going to the surrounding schools.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Lianne Dalziel</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. My question to her asked whether the two schools that are covered by enrolment zones had been informed that there would be a change to their enrolment zones. That was a very specific question, and she has not addressed it, at all.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I accept that that was the absolute thrust of the question. If the Minister has that information, I would appreciate it if the House could have it.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Gerry Brownlee</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The first point is that the Minister did say that the change-manager would take care of this matter. That has to be an answer.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon David Cunliffe</strong>: Count the votes, Gerry.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Gerry Brownlee</strong>: I am, don’t you worry.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I am on my feet. I say to the Hon David Cunliffe and the Hon Gerry Brownlee that when I am on my feet they will de—decease from interjecting.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Members</strong>: Decease!</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The Speaker can get tongue-tied too. I say to the member who has raised the point of order that the question asked whether the schools have been advised that the enrolment schemes would be changed. Whether someone is being appointed to change-manage the process is another matter. Whether the schools have advised is a fairly simple matter. The Minister may not have that information, and it is perfectly acceptable if she does not. If she does have the information, I think it is reasonable that it be provided to the House.</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: The decision was made yesterday afternoon. A change-manager is being appointed. I have no knowledge as to whether that change-manager has informed those schools. But they know that there will be one less school in the area, so it is normal that the enrolment schemes would be re-done.</p>
