        <strong>8.
 </strong>
        <strong>JEANETTE FITZSIMONS (Green)</strong> to the
 <strong>Prime Minister</strong>: Which specific countries was he referring to in the House yesterday when he said in response to my question, “countries that will find it easier than us” should do better than 40 percent in order to offset New Zealand’s “failure to act” on climate change?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:51:52"></a>
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH (Minister for Climate Change Issues)</strong> on behalf of the
 <strong>Prime Minister</strong>: The Prime Minister was not referring to any specific country. It is for individual countries to set their emissions targets and I do not propose to comment on what those specific targets should be. Independent assessments have reported New
 Zealand’s target to be credible and in line with our commitment to New Zealand doing its fair share.</p>
      <a name="page_13"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Jeanette Fitzsimons</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I asked a very specific question. I asked: “Which specific countries”. The Prime Minister volunteered yesterday that there were countries that could do more. I asked which ones they were. He has had that question for several hours. If there are any countries, surely he should be able to name them.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I do not need to hear further on this. The Prime Minister does not have to name them at all, because I think the answer was very clear that he did not have any particular country in mind. It is a perfectly acceptable answer to the question.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jeanette Fitzsimons</strong>: Is the Minister saying that he cannot name a single country that could pick up the slack for New Zealand doing 10-20 percent rather than 25-40 percent, as he suggested yesterday?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: The Government does not accept that the target New Zealand has set out is anything less than New Zealand’s fair share. I draw the member’s attention to some of the very comprehensive economic analysis showing that a 10-20 percent target for New Zealand is a very big ask if we take into account 50 percent coming from agriculture, the very large increase in emissions since 1990 of 24 percent―</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon David Cunliffe</strong>: Oh, shame!</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: Members opposite say shame, and I say shame, too. It is a shame that during the course of the last Labour Government, emissions in New Zealand grew by record amounts.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Pete Hodgson</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I apologise to both colleagues. I do not think the question was addressed. The first question was inviting the Prime Minister to name specific countries, and you ruled that he need not. That is fair enough. Then the question was asked whether that meant that the Prime Minister cannot name any country, and that question was not addressed.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I do not need anything further on this point, whatsoever. The questioner asked why the Prime Minister could not name the countries that were needed to take up the slack. The Minister challenged that assertion in the second part of the question. The Minister challenged the fact that there was an allegation made that slack needed to be taken up. As I heard it, the argument was that there was not. That was a perfectly fair answer to the question.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Rodney Hide</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. We have heard several points of order today, which have been ruled out on the content of Ministers’ answers. If we went back over question time, we would appreciate that the problem lies with the questions that are being asked and not the answers. I ask members through you to reflect on the fact that they are not listening to the answers. They are asking questions and when they do not get the answer they want they raise points of order.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I hear the point the honourable member makes. I am sure members will learn that if they want to get good answers the quality of the question does matter. That is something I have been trying to encourage all year.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: On what basis does the Prime Minister believe it is realistic to expect other countries to do more than New Zealand, when in New Zealand his Government has legislated to allow the agricultural sector, responsible for half of New Zealand’s emissions, to increase its emissions at the cost of taxpayers?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: On the issue of agricultural emissions, New Zealand has shown very considerable leadership. We are the very first country in the world to propose the inclusion of agriculture, at all, in an emissions trading scheme. I challenge the member to name a single country that is proposing to include agriculture. The
 second point is that the global alliance that the Prime Minister has advocated in respect of agricultural emissions is a very constructive contribution to this complex issue.</p>
      <a name="page_14"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jeanette Fitzsimons</strong>: Which countries does he think will find it easier than New Zealand to improve the fuel efficiency of their car fleet, given that New Zealand’s car fleet uses much more fuel per hundred kilometres than those of the EU, Japan, or even ofChina?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: The first point is that there have been a number of comprehensive economic analyses that show that in terms of reducing emissions the cost for New Zealand is considerably larger. In respect of transport, New Zealand is quite a thinly populated country that has less opportunity for public transport than some of the very intensely populated countries in Europe. In respect of vehicles, new standards are coming into place in respect of their emissions. The Government has taken the initiative of providing for no road-user charge, to encourage the development of electric cars.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jeanette Fitzsimons</strong>: Which countries does the Minister think will find it easier than New Zealand to plant new forests on unproductive land, given that the Green New Deal package released by the Greens last week shows how easily we could accumulate 33.6 million tonnes of carbon from forests before 2020?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: The Minister for Climate Change Issues has tabled a report from the Ministry for the Environment on the viability of the Green Party’s plan. That report is quite critical and states that it is unrealistic.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Jeanette Fitzsimons</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Greens Party’s plan was launched last week, and that report preceded it.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member will resume her seat, right now. She cannot litigate an answer by way of point of order. She has further supplementary questions if she believes that the Minister has given incorrect information. She can drill down into that with her further supplementary questions. I am sure the House would welcome it.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jeanette Fitzsimons</strong>: Which other countries have renewable energy opportunities as good as ours in geothermal and wind, plus a dirty old coal-powered station just waiting to be closed?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: New Zealand’s position in having 70 percent of our electricity already being renewable actually makes the challenge for us of reducing emissions considerably more challenging than those countries, many of whom in the OECD or the developed countries have only less than 10 percent of their electricity coming from renewable sources.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jeanette Fitzsimons</strong>: Does he stand by the statement to the House yesterday stating that although Cabinet had given him flexibility to negotiate our target above 20 percent, he had already ruled out doing so, regardless of the efforts of other countries?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: The premise on which the member bases her question is incorrect.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jeanette Fitzsimons</strong>: Is the Minister saying that if Barack Obama goes to Copenhagen saying “Yes, we can do much more.”, the Prime Minister will reply “No, we can’t, but can I still have a photo op?”.</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: I note that the target set and tabled by the United States is a 3 percent reduction in emissions on 1990 levels, compared with a 10 to 20 percent that New Zealand is proposing. I invite that member, who said she is going to Copenhagen with a sign saying she is ashamed to be a New Zealander, to reconsider.</p>
