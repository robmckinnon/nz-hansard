      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>9.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon TREVOR MALLARD (Labour—Hutt South)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Education</strong>: When she named Professor John Hattie yesterday as an academic who
 supported both national standards and the Government’s implementation methods, did she take into account the views he expressed to her with other academics in their letter of 25 November 2009?</p>
      <a name="page_15"></a>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_15:01:24"></a>
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY (Minister of Education)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> I took into account discussions that I have had with Professor Hattie, and, of course, his many writings. One very apt comment he has made is: “National
 standards offers the most wonderful opportunities for refreshing and reinvigorating an already top of the world system,”. But to correct the basis of the member’s question, I stated yesterday of Professor Hattie that he “invented
 them, so he should support them.” We may need to introduce listening standards for members opposite.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Did she take into account Professor Hattie’s statement that “There
 are many successful New Zealanders with unexceptional school records who would not have succeeded had they been constantly labelled as failures during their childhood. A better form of assessment and reporting would focus on the progress that children are making and we believe that this is the approach that should be being used.”, before she gave his name in response to a question yesterday that asked her to name an academic who supported both the national standards and the Government’s implementation methods?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: I do not understand why Labour and that member are so against national standards, which will identify and support children in our schools who are struggling to learn to read, write, and do maths. Professor Hattie has said many things. I have just given one quote. In another quote he said that standards, if implemented well, can make a huge difference. I say to that member that we are on the side of children and lifting academic standards. I do not know why Labour members do not come on board.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I think you probably know what it is. I quoted a very specific statement and asked the Minister whether she had taken it—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I think I can save the member some time. In fairness, I say that the member asked a very specific question that related directly to the primary question, and the answer is not very difficult, I would have thought. It was a very specific question about whether the Minister took into account that particular statement of Professor Hattie. I think it is fair enough that the House should receive an answer to that particular question.</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: Yes.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Did she take into account Professor Hattie’s statement that “reporting
 of results at each year level will distort and impoverish the culture of teaching and learning and assessment within schools. It will undermine the new curriculum …”, before she gave his name in response to a question yesterday that asked her to name an academic who supported both the national standards and the Government’s implementation methods?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: Yes, and I also took into account his statement “we
 cannot defend a system with one in ten schools deemed failing”.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Allan Peachey</strong>: What reports has the Minister seen that call for a discussion about national standards, other than the views of unions, which have always been opposed to them?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: I have received this comment from a school principal about national standards: “I have found it difficult to get rational discourse when I disagree with those strongly opposed. However, I do know other principals who share the same view I have. I have decided to just get on with it, which I am able to do with teachers who also view the standards positively.” I share that principal’s desire for rational
 discussion, and I wish the Opposition would come on board to lift the achievement of students and to back parents getting good information. Let us make a big change to education in this country.</p>
      <a name="page_16"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Did she take into account Professor John Hattie’s statement that “the
 flaws in the new system are so serious that full implementation of the intended national standards system over the next three years is unlikely to be successful. It will not achieve intended goals and is likely to lead to dangerous side effects.”, before she gave his name in response to a question yesterday that asked her to name an academic who supported both the national standards and the Government’s implementation methods?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: Yes, and I also took into account the fact that Professor John Hattie wrote <em>Directions for Assessment in New Zealand</em><strong></strong>, which recommended that standards be developed for both achievement levels and rates of progress. I also took into account that Professor Hattie is a member of the New Zealand Assessment Academy, whose members I met yesterday. They are working with the Ministry of Education on implementation methods, and are continuing to be extremely helpful and supportive in ensuring that we address the gaps in education by lifting the rates of reading, writing, and maths of those one in five children who are failing currently.</p>
