        <strong>3.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon ANNETTE KING (Deputy Leader—Labour)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister for Social Development and Employment</strong>: What reports has she received on New Zealand’s current unemployment rates?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:21:22"></a>
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS (Acting Minister for Social Development and Employment)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> I have seen a number of reports in relation to New Zealand’s current unemployment rate. One report shows that New Zealand is in the top third of the OECD—ninth out of 30 countries. New Zealand is performing well in a number of labour market indicators, having a low unemployment rate, high labour force participation, and a high employment rate. In fact, I could compare our rate with that of the UK, which is 7.8 percent, and that of the US, which is 9.7 percent; New Zealand’s rate is 6 percent.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: Is the Minister aware there are now 1,700 registered unemployed in Canterbury alone, and that her promise of 4,000 Job Ops placements for the entire country over the next 2 years is increasingly becoming a token gesture, leaving most young people without a job and not much hope; and will she now revisit the timid approach she has been taking in trying to assist struggling unemployed New Zealanders?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: I do not think anyone would ever accuse the Minister of being timid. However, noting how worrying it is for young people not to have work, I contrast the concern that this Government has for them with that of the previous Minister, Ruth Dyson, who stated that 29,000 jobs being lost was “not bad news at all”. She said that at the beginning of last year.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. My question had nothing to do with what the Hon Ruth Dyson did or did not do as Minister for Social Development and Employment. I asked the Minister whether she was aware that there are 1,700 young people unemployed in Canterbury alone, and that 4,000 Job Ops placements over the next 2 years just will not cut it, and what she will do about her timid approach.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I ask the House to respect the Standing Orders. When a point of order is being raised, the House will be silent so that it can be heard. I remind the honourable member that her question went on somewhat longer than that; in repeating it she left out a hunk of it. However, acknowledging that she left out a hunk of it, I think it would be helpful if the Minister did address the part of the question about whether any changes are proposed. I understood that to be the key part of the member’s question. If the Minister has any further information on that, the House will be obliged.</p>
      <a name="page_3"></a>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: I advised the member that I was aware of the situation. If she wants to ask me five questions in one, that is her problem.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Katrina Shanks</strong>: How will the Government continue to support those facing unemployment?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I hope the Minister heard the question, because I could not hear it at all.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: Yes, I did.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I apologise to the Minister. I ask the member to repeat the question, because I must be able to hear it. I ask members to show a little courtesy to their colleagues. That is all I am asking—not to be silent, but just show a little courtesy.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Katrina Shanks</strong>: How will the Government continue to support those facing unemployment?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: This Government is committed to creating economic conditions for sustainable jobs, so that when people find themselves out of work they are able to move into another job quickly. We recognise that losing a job creates an enormous amount of stress on individuals and families. That is why we will continue to do everything we can—much more than the previous Government did when the recession first hit—to get people back into work as soon as we can.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: If her Job Ops scheme is so successful, as she has been claiming, why have only 29 young people in the whole central region found work through the scheme, while at the same time unemployment in the Wairarapa has tripled, leading the local newspaper to state that the situation is bleak for people living there; and will she now rename her flagship programme from Job Ops to “Job Flops”?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: That member might find it funny that young people are out of work, but this Government does not. That is why I am very pleased to be able to say that one-third of all people who go to Work and Income at the moment looking for work are able to go either straight into work or into training; they do not go straight on to a benefit, which is what that member would rather see.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>: Tēnā koe, Mr Speaker. Kia ora tātou katoa. How many young people have been placed on Job Ops and Community Max since the Youth Opportunities scheme was announced on 2 August?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: I am pleased to report that in only 7 weeks employers have listed over 1,206 job opportunities. That means that 625 young people are now gaining valuable work experience—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Lianne Dalziel</strong>: What about the normal jobs they have been advertising? There’s nothing new. They are not new jobs.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: —I know that Ms Dalziel may not like to hear it—and 30 percent of those are young Māori. For Community Max, there are already 267 opportunities available. One of the first Community Max projects that Minister Turia launched was with Ngāti Rangi in Ōhākune. It is investing $152 million in young people and creating almost 17,000 new opportunities. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I call question No. 4, Dr Paul Hutchison. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] This time it is the Labour members. I ask the Labour members to treat the House with a little more courtesy. This is the New Zealand Parliament; many people are watching it and listening to it. I ask the members to treat it with a little more courtesy.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I draw to your attention the orchestrated clapping that preceded those interjections from Labour members. If you are going to tidy up one side, then I think you have to stop the orchestration on the other side.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Let me be very clear and polite to the honourable member, who risks questioning my even-handedness in this House. The applause stopped when I
 called Dr Hutchison. The interjections went on and on, and that is my concern. I am not troubled by some interjection and some noise. I am not asking people to be silent; I am just asking people to treat the House with a little more courtesy.</p>
