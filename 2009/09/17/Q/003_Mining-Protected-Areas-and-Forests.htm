        <strong>3.
 </strong>
        <strong>METIRIA TUREI (Co-Leader—Green)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Energy and Resources</strong>:
 When he said that “A report circulated by the World Bank some years ago ranked New Zealand second in
 the world in terms of natural wealth per capita”, was he aware that protected areas and forests make up 29 percent of that wealth, whereas subsoil assets make up just 3 percent?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:17:17"></a>
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE (Minister of Energy and Resources)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Yes. The general point I was trying to make was that everyone knows that New Zealand has magnificent, pristine, and very beautiful natural resources in the form of our conservation estates above ground. There is no question about that. But without wanting to make a
 personal statement, I suggest
 that the member has taken me somewhat out of context. I do agree with her statement that it is clear that environmental goals can be met alongside responsible mining.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Metiria Turei</strong>: Does the Minister, then, agree that 29 percent is bigger than 3 percent?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: Can I come back to the member on that later?</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jacqui Dean</strong>: How could responsible mining contribute to lifting New Zealand’s economic performance?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: Mining uses just 40 square kilometres of the New Zealand land mass, which is less than 0.015 percent of New Zealand’s total land area. The export value of that mining activity is $175,000 per hectare. Dairy farming by comparison uses 20,000 square kilometres, with an export value of only $3,500. I note that it is Green Party policy to get rid of dairy farming, as well.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: Is the Minister confused by the word “national” in national parks into thinking his party can ride roughshod over the long tradition in New Zealand that national parks should be conserved as they are and not mined?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: Not at all.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Metiria Turei</strong>: If the Minister thinks the Stockton mine—a photo of which I have here—is a good example of good environmental mining, is he happy to see our national parks looking like the Stockton mine?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: I make it very clear that no one is talking about mining our national parks. We are saying that there is a huge amount of land in schedule 4 of the Crown Minerals Act, and we simply want to have a look at it to see what is there. I do not see what the Green Party is so particularly wound up about, especially given the member’s own statement that it is clear that it
 “is possible
 to balance the economic concerns of miners and the conservation concerns of protecting endangered species in such a way that all parties are happy.”</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Tim Groser</strong>: Is the Minister aware that according to advice provided by the Department of Conservation to the Minister of Conservation, no fewers than 82 separate mines were operating on Department of Conservation land on the Labour Government’s watch, mining everything from gold through to limestone; and is he able to explain to a totally confused New Zealand public why Labour members would describe that mining on its watch as a win-win environment-economic result, but when the issue of mining on Department of Conservation land is raised under National it is called rape and pillage?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: Yes, I am aware of that extraordinary contradiction in views. I assume that it was that situation that led Metiria Turei to make the statement that “it is possible to balance the economic concerns of miners and the conservation concerns of protecting endangered species in such a way that all parties are happy.” For
 9 years the Green Party supported Labour in its efforts. Now, because National wants to take a responsible approach to this matter, everything is all wrong.</p>
      <a name="page_7"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Metiria Turei</strong>: Can the Minister confirm that he has ruled out from the stocktake that he intends to undertake all of the land contained within all of New Zealand’s national parks?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: The member knows which bits of the national parks are in schedule 4—all of them, in fact. But we have said that we are doing a stocktake of the lands in schedule 4—end of story. I also say that the process will be very, very public, and any decisions that result from it will be able to be judged by the public. What do the Greens have against the jobs of the many thousands of New Zealanders who work in these industries each and every year?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Dr Russel Norman</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The question was quite specific: will the stocktake cover national parks, or not? The Minister has not addressed that part of the question.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I believe that the Minister did. He said the stocktake covers the land in schedule 4, and that does include parks. I believe he answered the question.</p>
