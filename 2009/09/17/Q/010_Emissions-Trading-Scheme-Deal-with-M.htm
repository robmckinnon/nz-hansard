      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>10.
 </strong>
        <strong>DAVID GARRETT (ACT)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister for Climate Change Issues</strong>: Has he a written document of what has been agreed to with the Māori Party, to advance the Government’s amendments to the emissions trading scheme to a select committee; if so, will he table it?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:50:13"></a>
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH (Minister for Climate Change Issues)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Yes. The agreement was by way of an exchange of letters between leaders. It is not appropriate to release those letters at this time, because we are working through the details of a number of proposals, and we wish to do that directly with the Māori Party, and not through public discourse, as we do with negotiations with other parties, including ACT. I would be happy to table the 13 bullet points that cover all the features of the agreement.
 </p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>David Garrett</strong>: Does the Minister have an estimate of what the agreement with the Māori Party will cost taxpayers, and, given that the agreement is only to support the referral to a select committee, what does he think the cost of an agreement for a second and third reading of the bill will be?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: The agreement we have in good faith with the Māori Party is to work through the details around some key initiatives for providing home insulation, as my colleague said, for low-income households. There are details about our working through a national policy statement on biodiversity under the Resource Management Act. There is a total of 13 initiatives, and I have every confidence that we can work cooperatively with the Māori Party to ensure its support for the second and third readings.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Craig Foss</strong>: Which of the 13 elements in the agreement with the Māori Party will be included in legislation to be introduced next week?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: The details of the 50 percent obligation, the $25 fixed price option, and the additional allocation for fishing industry to quota holders will be included in the bill next week. Other details like the Treaty clause are subject to work by officials, including Crown Law officials, in consultation with the Māori Party. Most of the other elements of the agreement do not require legislation. They are being worked on by officials in consultation with the Māori Party. We will announce those details when they are finalised.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Shane Jones</strong>: Does he stand by his earlier public statement: “A separate
 Maori party will not help us find solutions to challenges, but will polarise the debate.”; if so, why is he encouraging the segregation of Māori climate change obligations from the rest of the New Zealand community?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: I am not. If the member looks in detail at the bill next week, he will see that although it is certainly true that Māori have a very large interest in industries like fishing, forestry, and agriculture, we have been very plain that there will not be—and the Māori Party has not asked for—any different rules for Māori in those industries than what there are for other New Zealanders.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>David Garrett</strong>: Can the Minister confirm whether the deal involves benefit hikes, and whether the energy-efficiency assistance for home insulation is, in fact, for all low-income households, or just for Māori low-income households?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: On the first point, I say that the way our system of benefits works is that they are adjusted by CPI each year, and when the increased cost of both fuel and power—which we have halved as part of the agreement—flows through, there will be an adjustment for those benefits. In respect of the issues raised, the focus of the
 Māori Party has been a concern around low-income households, and it has not asked that the allocations be made specifically on the basis of any ethnicity.</p>
      <a name="page_14"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Shane Jones</strong>: Can the Minister explain why the Māori concessions are good for Papatūānuku, as reflected in the Māori Party commentary, or is this a case of the Government preaching indigenous declaration but acceding to indigenous desecration?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: I find that interesting from a member of the Opposition. I remind him that during the time of the previous Labour administration emissions grew by 24 percent.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Members</strong>: Answer the question!</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: Members opposite do not like it, but the reality is that their climate change record was an international embarrassment. Under this Government, with an effective agreement with the Māori Party we will have a very responsible approach to both climate change as well as the broader economic interests of Māori and other New Zealanders.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>: What measures has the Government agreed to in order to ensure that the obligations of the Crown to Māori, including the ones under the Treaty of Waitangi, are not compromised by the New Zealand emissions trading scheme?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: The Māori Party has strongly advocated that position out of concern that Māori should not carry a disproportionate share of the costs of reducing emissions because of their concentration of economic interests in primary industry, and because of Māori being disproportionately represented in low-income households. Many of the 13 elements agreed on address this, including a specific Treaty clause in the law, additional allocations to fishing quota holders, involvement for Māori in international negotiations over forestry offset, agreements to work through the issues for pre-emissions trading scheme forest settlements, measures to lower the cost increases for petrol and power, as well as the extension of the home insulation scheme for low-income households.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Darren Hughes</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Minister, Dr Smith, indicated he would table some documents in the House. He appears to have forgotten that.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: I seek the leave of the House to table the key features negotiated between the Māori Party and the Government with respect to the emissions trading scheme.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that document. Is there any objection? There is no objection.</p>
