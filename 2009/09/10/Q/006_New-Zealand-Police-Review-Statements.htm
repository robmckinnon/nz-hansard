      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>6.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon CLAYTON COSGROVE (Labour—Waimakariri)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Police</strong>: Does she agree with all of the recent statements made by herself, the Prime Minister, and the New Zealand Police in regard to reviews currently being undertaken by the New Zealand Police; if not, which statements does she disagree with?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:32:42"></a>
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS (Minister of Police)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> No, because police have advised me that some recent comments attributed to the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Rob Pope, had been taken out of context. Those comments were in relation to ideas that the police executive have been contemplating and discussing for some time, and Deputy Police Commissioner Rob Pope is very disappointed.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Clayton Cosgrove</strong>: Which statement is correct: the Prime Minister’s statement of 2 September 2009 that the Government has no intention of closing police stations in any area, or the statement from a police spokesperson on the same day that the review covers “any property”?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: Obviously, the Prime Minister is always right. That is why about 70 percent of New Zealanders think it is great having him as the Prime Minister. That is one of the reasons why that member’s leader has about a 6 percent rating in the polls.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Clayton Cosgrove</strong>: Which statement is correct: her statement last Thursday, 3 September 2009, that “We are certainly not planning
 on closing any stations, and we’ve made that perfectly plain to police.”, or the report in the <em>Wairarapa Times-Age</em><strong></strong> the next day, 4 September 2009, that the Wellington Police District communications manager, Elizabeth Young, “did not rule out the possibility that stations could be closed and said any rural Wairarapa stations were being included in the same review process that was taking place around the country”?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: Quite clearly, I am right. If the member doubts that, he should ask the Commissioner of Police.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Sandra Goudie</strong>: What recent statements made by the New Zealand Police regarding reviews does the Minister agree with?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: I agree with many statements made by the police, such as the 24 June 2009 statement from the Commissioner of Police in relation to police cars.
 He said: “We would expect the operational mileage to be maintained at the levels it is now. What we’re actually asking our district staff to do is actually coordinate the use of their vehicles in a more efficient way than they do now. You go to a police station during the night or during the day and you will find police cars—marked cars, unmarked cars—sitting in the car park.” I also agree with the statement from the police general manager of finance and planning, Bruce Simpson, on 2 September: “there is no list of police stations, or other property, scheduled for closure.”, and his statement on 8 September: “There is no Government savings target of $20 million.” Finally, in relation to the review of police firearms training, I agree with Assistant Commissioner Operations Viv Rickard, who told Radio New Zealand yesterday that it was not a cost-cutting measure, it never had been, and the police had started work on it a couple of years ago.</p>
      <a name="page_7"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Keith Locke</strong>: Does the Minister agree with the latest police proposal to give officers the power to impose instant fines on people they deem guilty of disorderly behaviour, such as people on political protests; and why should the police have the right to be judge, jury, and penaliser on such matters?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: It is one of the issues that Deputy Police Commissioner Rob Pope was very concerned had been taken out of context. As to any proposals, I have not seen them, because they are at an early stage. I suggest that the member wait until they come through, because I certainly would not agree with a lot of the things he has just said.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Sandra Goudie</strong>: What other police statements regarding reviews does the Minister agree with?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: A slightly shorter list this time, please.</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: Yes, it is. I agree with the 2 September statement from the police general manager of finance and planning, Bruce Simpson, that the police are “looking at our property portfolio to ensure we are making the best use of our investment in them.” The police property portfolio is worth $665 million, and it would be reckless not to regularly review it. Presumably, that was why it was reviewed five times under Labour’s watch, with 37 properties sold.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Clayton Cosgrove</strong>: Given that it is alleged that the Prime Minister is always right, which statement is correct: the Prime Minister’s statement reported in the <em>Dominion Post
 </em><strong></strong>on 3 September 2009 that the rationalisation of the police property portfolio might include holiday homes as police have “quite a bit of stuff in that area”; or the statement made by the police spokesperson reported in the same article that the police did not own any holiday homes, and the houses referred to were those attached to small rural stations—given that the Prime Minister is always right!</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: The Prime Minister is always right, except occasionally when someone has given him the wrong information. Otherwise, he always is right.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Clayton Cosgrove</strong>: When the Minister stated on 2 September, 2009 “This
 Government has already opened five new police stations this year, with a sixth, in Christchurch South, due to be opened on September 11.”, was she aware that all of those new police stations had been planned, started, and funded under the previous Labour Government; and will she acknowledge that as she cuts the ribbon this week?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon JUDITH COLLINS</strong>: There are two issues there to deal with. The first is this: I was wrong; we have not opened five. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] Wait—we have opened six. I am sorry about that! We are opening the seventh tomorrow. Having said that, with regard to funding, which the member talked about, that is one of the reasons why he is in the Opposition and we are in the Government. Funding is paid for by the taxpayers of New Zealand, and he forgot that.</p>
