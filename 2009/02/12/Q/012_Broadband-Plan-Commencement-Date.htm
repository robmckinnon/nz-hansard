      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>12.
 </strong>
        <strong>CLARE CURRAN (Labour—Dunedin South)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister for Communications and Information Technology</strong>: What is the Government’s target date for the commencement of its $1.5 billion broadband plan, given reported anxiety in the industry?</p>
      <a name="page_17"></a>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_15:11:25"></a>
        <strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE (Minister for Communications and Information Technology)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> At the time the policy was originally announced we advised that the new Government would spend the first year consulting the public and industry, and getting the investment structure right. By year 6 we will have rolled out ultra-fast broadband to businesses, schools, health facilities, and the first tranche of homes. By year 10 we expect that 75 percent of the population will have access to ultra-fast broadband.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Clare Curran</strong>: Is the Minister planning to use electricity lines companies as a vehicle to roll out its broadband plan, as suggested in today’s
 <em>New Zealand Herald?</em><strong></strong></p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE</strong>: The Government is working through a range of options and will have more to say on that very shortly.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Melissa Lee</strong>: Who has expressed the most anxiety over the Government’s ambitious plans to invest $1.5 billion in ultra-fast broadband for New Zealand?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE</strong>: It would appear that the person who is most anxious, according to the
 <em>New Zealand Herald
 </em><strong></strong>this morning, is the former Minister for Communications and Information Technology, the Hon David Cunliffe. I am just trying to divine whether he is genuinely anxious, is anxious for party political reasons, is a naturally anxious person, or is going through a personally anxious period as he tries to work out when to make his bid for the leadership of the Labour Party.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Clare Curran</strong>: Why, in the current economic climate, is the Minister seeking to reinvent the wheel on the roll-out of broadband and creating anxiety and loss of confidence in the telecommunications sector, when he would be better to use the existing industry-supported mechanisms developed by the previous Labour Government?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE</strong>: The previous plan by the previous Labour Government was for a $325 million grant scheme. Our plan is for a $1.5 billion investment in ultra-fast broadband. I note that the biff was so urgent for the previous Government that it took it 8 years of its 9 years in Government to get around to announcing it.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Clare Curran</strong>: I seek leave to table an article in the <em>Sunday Star-Times</em><strong></strong>, titled “Nervous telcos play second-guess game”, which claims that the National Government does not have a clue how it will implement its broadband plan.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member has described the document perfectly adequately and—here we go again—is seeking leave to table something in the newspaper, which the Standing Orders Committee made very clear is something we do not wish to see happening. I am obliged to seek leave but I think members will reject it. Leave is sought. Is there objection? There is.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Dr Michael Cullen</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. My colleague was seeking leave, there was a barrage of interjections, and you validated those interjections by indicating what was already being indicated by the members opposite. I suggest that that is not appropriate.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member will take his seat. I accept that there were faults all round. The member, in seeking leave, went on far too long. It was my fault that I let the member go on too long in describing the press statement. That led to disorderly behaviour by some members. I accept that it was actually my fault that that happened. I will now put the request for leave again, just to make sure there is no misunderstanding. Leave has been sought to table a press statement. Is there any objection? There is objection.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Clare Curran</strong>: I seek leave to table an article in today’s
 <em>New Zealand Herald
 </em><strong></strong>that speculates that the Minister is planning to use electricity lines companies but also—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: We now have a clear understanding of what that press statement is. Is there any objection to that being tabled? There is objection.</p>
      <a name="page_18"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. During that seeking of leave,
 Nick Smith interjected. You did not call him on that. I think all of us over here could hear him, and we just want to know whether the rules will apply both ways.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: The issue that concerned me was that you, Mr Speaker, had just given a ruling and guidance to members that they should not seek leave to table newspaper articles. It was somewhat a deriding of you as Speaker for the member to immediately get to her feet and seek leave to table another newspaper article. It was almost like she was snubbing the Speaker, and that caused me concern.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] When the Speaker is on his feet the member the Hon Darren Hughes will be silent. We had a new member seeking to table press statements—and I do not blame her because plenty of members have done that. The Standing Orders Committee reviewed this issue and has given clear advice to the House that that should not become our practice. I am not able to decline leave as I tried to do when leave was sought by the Minister the Hon Phil Heatley. I was wrong and I should have let him seek leave for that, as I was obliged to put to the House the member’s seeking leave to table a press statement. The Standing Orders Committee has made it very clear that this is not good practice for this House, and I urge all members to refrain from seeking to table a press statement unless it is in some exceptional circumstance. I think we should let the matter rest there.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Are you going to rule on the original point of order that I made, which was that Nick Smith interjected during a point of order? You have not yet.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member will sit down. I am ruling on it. As I heard it Nick Smith just gasped at what was going on. That is the end of the matter.</p>
