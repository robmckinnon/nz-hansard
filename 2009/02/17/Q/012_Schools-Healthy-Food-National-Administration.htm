      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>12.
 </strong>
        <strong>SUE KEDGLEY (Green)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Education</strong>: Did she seek advice from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, or Sport and Recreation New Zealand on her decision to remove the National Administrative Guideline requiring schools to sell only healthy food; if so, what concerns, if any, were raised?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:54:49"></a>
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY (Minister of Education)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> As I am the Minister of Education I sought advice from the Ministry of Education. A concern was raised that money previously spent on the policy may be seen by the public to have been wasted. The ministry also advised me that, as with any policy change, there was a risk of some criticism. What has become clear to me from discussions with the sector is that this regulation was confusing and burdensome. Rather than retain onerous regulations for boards of trustees and principals, this Government trusts them to make appropriate choices about healthy food. The Minister of Health totally supports the decision.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Sue Kedgley</strong>: How can the Minister claim that schools were confused and opposed to the guidelines, when public health nutritionist Bronwen King says:
 “Contrary to what is
 being suggested, most schools, in our experience, have embraced the guideline positively and have been right behind providing a food environment that promotes better learning and behaviour.”, and when a Waikato school food coordinator I spoke to
 earlier today said she had not heard of one complaint about the guidelines amongst the 150 schools that she deals with?</p>
      <a name="page_14"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: We accept that many schools have done work in the area to ensure that their students can make informed decisions. We are not asking schools to change their existing practices. They are free to decide on an individual school basis how they promote healthy food and drink. From all the comments that I have seen in the media and have received personally, our confidence in schools’ judgment is well placed.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Chris Carter</strong>: Can the Minister explain what she meant in her press release of 5 February 2009, when justifying her decision to reintroduce junk food into school canteens, when she said that the decision had nothing to do with teaching and learning, despite extensive educational research that shows strong linkages between diet and classroom behaviour, and that childhood eating patterns are a strong determining factor leading to adult obesity?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: I think there is a general acknowledgement that there is no silver bullet to solve the obesity problem. Unlike the Labour Government we will not be using computer games on expensive websites to lure kids out into the playing fields. As Minister of Education I am focused on getting more schoolchildren engaged in regular physical activity, and on working with the Minister of Health and the Minister for Sport and Recreation on plans to get more schoolchildren regularly participating in sports teams and clubs.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Allan Peachey</strong>: What reports has the Minister received in response to her decision to remove clause 3 from National Administration Guideline 5?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: I have seen several positive reports from school boards of trustees and principals. I have seen a press statement from the New Zealand School Trustees Association, which stated: “At the practical level, many schools could see that their efforts would be better placed focused on the more important task of improving learning outcomes for all students, rather than becoming the food police.” I have also received numerous positive emails from principals, one of whom wrote to me and said: “I just wanted to say how pleased I was to actually see a Minister of Education take away excessive and unnecessary work for staff and principals. Anything that gives me more time to concentrate on teaching students how to read, write, and do maths is great, in my book.”</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Sue Kedgley</strong>: Can the Minister confirm that as a result of her decision, there are now no minimum standards for schools about the food and drink they sell, and that schools are now free to sell whatever high-fat, high-sugar junk food they like, even if it undermines the school food guidelines and contributes to rotting teeth, type 2 diabetes, and bad behaviour; and is the Minister becoming the Marie Antoinette of education Ministers, advising school boards: “Let them eat cake, drink coke, and go nuts.”?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The Minister may answer whatever part of that question she chooses to.</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: I think that the member is rather exaggerating, and I refer her back to the announcement. Schools are still required to promote healthy food under National Administration Guideline 5.2. I believe that the scenario the member has raised is most unlikely. At the end of the day, this Government trusts schools more than that member and will not retain regulations that are burdensome to comply with and can be thwarted by a kid hopping over the fence and buying a pie at the local dairy. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I ask members to show the member asking the question some courtesy. It is difficult to hear.</p>
      <a name="page_15"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Sue Kedgley</strong>: Can the member confirm that although there is an obligation to promote healthy food, there is absolutely no obligation on any school in New Zealand to sell healthy food; and has she seen the Public Health Association’s release, which says that her decision flies in the face of latest international evidence on the link between obesity and behaviour, that it is a giant step backwards, that it is an ill-advised decision that appears to have been made on no evidence, and that it flies in the face of clear evidence of harm?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member will resume her seat. I invited her to ask a supplementary question, not make a speech. I call the Hon Anne Tolley, and not too long please Minister.</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: The majority of students bring food from home. The previous rule did not stop students from taking unhealthy food to school or stopping off at the local dairy or pie shop on the way to and from school.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Chris Carter</strong>: I seek leave to table a response from the
 health foundation
 condemning the Minister’s move.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that document. Is there any objection? There is objection.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Sue Kedgley</strong>: I seek leave to table a statement by a dentist—Dr Rob
 Beaglehole saying it is a retrograde step that will have negative ramifications for children’s health and teeth.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table a statement by a dentist. Is there any objection to that? There is objection.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Sue Kedgley</strong>: I seek leave to table a statement by the National Heart Foundation pointing out the huge benefits in the classroom in terms of learning and concentration when children consume nutritious food.</p>
      <ul class="">
        <li>Document, by leave, laid on the Table of the House.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Sue Kedgley</strong>: Finally, I seek leave to table a release by the Public Health Association saying that the decision appears to have been made based on no evidence and that it flies in the face of clear evidence of the harm caused by overeating and obesity.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I want to make this clear; is it a press release?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Sue Kedgley</strong>: It is a press release.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: It is a press release. Is there any objection that press release being tabled? There is.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Rodney Hide</strong>: I seek leave to table a document showing that for the Greens, it is OK for our kids to smoke dope, but what they cannot do is have a cake now and again.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is being sought to table that document. Is there any objection to that document being tabled? No,
 there is no
 objection, but I do stress that the document must be tabled before the end of the House today.</p>
      <ul class="">
        <li>Document, by leave, laid on the Table of the House.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Keith Locke</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I do not know quite what document—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The House has already dealt with that document.</p>
