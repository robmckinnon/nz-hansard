        <strong>11.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon PAREKURA HOROMIA (Labour—Ikaroa-Rāwhiti)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of
 Māori Affairs</strong>: Did he make any submissions to the Minister of Labour on the minimum wage review; if not, why not?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_15:03:05"></a>
        <strong>Hon Dr PITA SHARPLES (Minister of
 Māori Affairs)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong>Tēnā koe. Tēnātātou. Yes, I did.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Parekura Horomia</strong>: Does the Minister understand that
 Māori workers will feel short-changed by the $3.78 per week increase, and by the fact that the Prime Minister, John Key, has confirmed that the
 Māori Party was told of the decision after it was made—hardly a mana-enhancing process?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr PITA SHARPLES</strong>: I am not sure which part of the question I should answer.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Members</strong>: All of it!</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon Dr PITA SHARPLES</strong>: OK. My submission was for an increase in the basic wage to $15 an hour, incrementally—in two steps. Of course I understand the value of the minimum wage. If there is an increase, it gives an incentive for
 Māori to stay in employment.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Parekura Horomia</strong>: I therefore suggest and remind that Minister—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order!</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Gerry Brownlee</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I do not think I need to hear the point of order. The member will resume his seat. He should remember that he is no longer a Minister. He does not suggest; he asks questions.</p>
      <a name="page_15"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Parekura Horomia</strong>: Would the Minister agree with me that the last time the National Party was in Government it took the minimum wage up 86c over 9 years, and that the previous Labour Government took the minimum wage up nine times?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The
 Māori Party is interested in this sort of discussion, but I did not actually hear the question. Could you ask the member to repeat the question, please.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: If members did not hear it, I am prepared to ask the honourable member to repeat it so that all members can hear it.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Parekura Horomia</strong>: Does the Minister appreciate that the last time National was in Government it took the minimum wage up by 86c over 9 years, and the previous Labour Government took it up nine times—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hone Harawira</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. That was not the question that he asked the first time.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member will resume his seat. I must say to members that I am very impressed that Hone Harawira could determine that, because I could not. It was very difficult for me to hear the first version of the question, and therefore it is extraordinarily difficult for me to rule on it. I would ask the Minister, if he is prepared to answer the question, to please answer it.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Gerry Brownlee</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. If you reflect on that question, you will find that the Minister has absolutely no responsibility for any matters raised in that sort of question.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: In the interests of fairness I am prepared to allow the member to rephrase his question. But I would point out that Ministers have a custodial responsibility for factual information about their departments’ activities that go beyond the current Government’s term, but they have no responsibility for policies of another party. In the interests of fairness I am prepared to allow the honourable member the chance to ask his question and—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Dr Michael Cullen</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I just seek some clarification of that last point. Clearly, the Minister has no responsibility for another party’s policies, but factual information about what happened under a previous Government is a somewhat different matter, I would suggest.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: As I understand the member’s point of order, that is correct. Factual information about what transpired under a previous Government is material that the current Minister has custodial information about, but he is not responsible for another party’s policies. I invite the honourable member to ask the question. Given the confusion, in fairness I think he should have a chance to ask his question.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Parekura Horomia</strong>: Does the Minister agree that the previous National Government took the minimum wage up by 86c over a period of 9 long years, and that the previous Labour Government took it up nine times, and is the Minister prepared to say what effect that will have on
 Māori workers?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member has asked for information going back a couple of Governments ago. I do not think he can expect the current Minister to have that information at his fingertips. It goes back beyond the 9 years of the previous Labour Government, as I understood the member’s question. I do not see how he can expect the current Minister to have information going back as far as that. In the interests of fairness to the member, I will give him one more chance to ask a question, but I make it clear—.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon Dr PITA SHARPLES</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am happy to answer the question.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: If the Minister feels comfortable answering the question, I will allow him to do so.</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr PITA SHARPLES</strong>: My answer is no and no.</p>
      <a name="page_16"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Dr Michael Cullen</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Do we take from that answer that the Minister made a submission on the minimum wage in complete ignorance of—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member knows, as one who is most knowledgable about the Standing Orders, that that is not a point of order, and it is not appreciated when he raises that kind of point of order.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>:
 Tēnā koe, Mr Speaker. Kia ora
 tātou. Is the Minister concerned that after 9 years of a Labour Government the
 Māori unemployment rate, which is 9.6 percent, is over twice as high as the general unemployment rate? How does he think lifting the minimum wage will change this?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr PITA SHARPLES</strong>: Yes, I am concerned, and our commitment is to lift the minimum wage, and to ensure that there is sufficient incentive for
 Māori to stay in the Labour market and not to opt out.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Parekura Horomia</strong>: Does the Minister agree that when the previous Labour Government came in the unemployment rate was running generally at 21.2 percent, and that the previous Labour Government brought unemployment down to 4 percent for the mainstream and 7 percent for
 Māori, and also kept
 Māori in the workforce a lot more than any other people?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I stress that that question is getting a fair way away from the primary question.</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr PITA SHARPLES</strong>: Unfortunately, it still is a high rate for under-24-year-olds at this time—18 percent.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hone Harawira</strong>:
 Tēnā koe, Mr Speaker. Why did you make a submission to the Minister of Labour to advocate for lifting the minimum wage to $15 an hour?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Although I am sure you do lots of things, I doubt very much that you made a submission to the Minister of Labour.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I appreciate the honourable member’s concern, but interrupting a question is—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Mr Speaker, you made it clear last year, as a result of a submission by the Hon Bill English, that you would be strict about this matter. I think it applies to Government members and their—what are they called–supporters, as well as to Labour members.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I accept the member’s point. I invite the honourable member to state his question again so that the Minister can hear it afresh.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hone Harawira</strong>: My apologies, Mr Speaker. Why did the Minister of
 Māori Affairs make a submission to the Minister of Labour to advocate lifting the minimum wage to $15 an hour?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr PITA SHARPLES</strong>: Because it is my role as Minister of
 Māori Affairs to advocate
 Māori aspirations for an optimal quality of life.</p>
