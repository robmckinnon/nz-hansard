        <strong>4.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon ANNETTE KING (Deputy Leader—Labour)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister for Social Development and Employment</strong>: Does she stand by her statement “NGOs play a vital role in supporting the most vulnerable members of our society”; if so, why?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:30:14"></a>
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE (Leader of the House)</strong> on behalf of the
 <strong>Minister for Social Development and Employment</strong>: Yes; in these difficult economic times, a partnership between Government and the non-governmental organisation sector is more important that ever.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: Why have non-governmental organisations that are part of the Pathways to Partnership programme been told that they will not receive the $29 million of additional funding expected in the 2009-10 financial year, at a time when the non-governmental organisations are under considerable pressure to provide more services; and if the Government can find $9 million to fund a task force to advise the Minister of Māori Affairs, why can the same priority not be put on funding services for vulnerable New Zealanders?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: The only information given to non-governmental organisations suggesting that the entire funding was going to be cut has come from Labour members of Parliament, who have been scaremongering from one end of the country to the other. The Government continues an unprecedented dialogue with the non-governmental organisation sector, and is continuing to work on progress towards the Budget.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: If she believes non-governmental organisations do play a vital role in supporting vulnerable members of our society, why have non-governmental organisations that are part of the Te Rito family violence network been told that their contracts for service are to be reduced from 3 years to annual contracts; and does she have any idea how disruptive and costly that change is for the non-governmental organisations and for the people they serve?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: The Ministry of Social Development has in excess of 2,500 contracts with non-governmental organisations. The practice of the previous
 Government was to routinely cut out a number of those contracts in any given year. I will not respond to the scaremongering from the Labour Party. The Government is involved in dialogue with the non-governmental organisation sector and we are progressing towards the Budget.</p>
      <a name="page_8"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Earlier today you said that members must ask specific questions to get specific answers. I asked a very specific question. I asked why non-governmental organisations that play a vital role as part of the Te Rito family violence network have been told that their contracts will no longer be 3 years, but will be reduced to annual contracts. The Minister went nowhere near an answer to that at all.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I accept that. I think that an answer to the question is reasonable. The Minister does not have to do so if he does not believe it is in the public interest, but I believe that a reasonable question has been asked and I invite the Minister to answer it.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: I gave an answer before that said that the ministry has some 2,500 contracts with non-governmental organisations. The question today from the Labour Party started by asking why all this funding has been cut, and now members opposite want to know why it is not a 3 year track but only a 1 year track. What I have said is that contracts in those arrangements change from year to year. The member will need to wait for the Budget to know exactly what the Government has planned and negotiated with the non-governmental organisation sector.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: Why does the criteria to be used in the Minister’s community response package, which is about to be announced, specifically exclude assistance for growing demand for services at a time when, for example, the Salvation Army has seen a 44 percent jump in the number of food parcels distributed in the first quarter of this year; or does she think that a rise in unemployment is just a “blimp”, as she has said?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: I reply by saying simply that I will not reply to a question about an announcement that has not yet been made.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Tim Macindoe</strong>: What commitment has the Government demonstrated towards working with the non-governmental organisation sector?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: Unlike the previous Government, which shut up shop and refused to talk to people when times got tough, this Government is taking a proactive approach. The Minister has met with the sector on a number of occasions, and the sector has had direct input into decisions that are being made as part of the Budget process. We talk to people about issues that concern them, regardless of whether they agree with us.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: Has the Minister seen a press release issued yesterday from within her electorate, headed “Bennett lets down Waitakere voices”; and how many more electorates does she intend to let down by ignoring the pleas of non-governmental organisations for proper consultation and adequate funding to address the growing number of New Zealanders who need a hand up in these hard times?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: No; but I do not make a habit of reading Labour electorate committee press releases.</p>
