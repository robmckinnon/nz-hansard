            <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I cannot hear the Minister who is taking the call. The Speaker is on his feet, and the Hon Annette King, the Hon David Cunliffe, and the Hon Trevor
 Mallard are all carrying on a discussion. That is not acceptable. I could not hear the Hon Dr Pita Sharples take his call. I call him now.</p>

            <strong>Hon Dr PITA SHARPLES</strong>: Tēnā koe, Mr Speaker. Tēnā tātou e te Whare e huihuinga i tēnei rangi.</p>

          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Now look, I say that senior members the Hon Maurice Williamson and the Hon Tau Henare were both interjecting when the Hon Pita Sharples, their own ministerial colleague, raised the point of order—</p>

          <p class="a">I move, yet again,
 <em>That the Māori Trustee Amendment Bill be now read a third time</em><strong></strong>. This is an extremely significant day in the life of this Parliament. It is a time to honour all those who have placed the issue of the Māori Trustee firmly on the political agenda for decades, long before we came to this House. I acknowledge the challenges of the Hēnare and Wright review in 1989, of the Charters, Sykes, and Nīkora review of 1991—</p>
          <p class="Intervention">
            <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I cannot tell whether it is about Auckland things or what is happening down in that corner of the Chamber, but we are trying to focus on the Minister of Māori Affairs, and National members appear to be having a sub-caucus meeting down there.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</strong>: Thank you for that. Yes, conversations will be held in the lobbies, not within the House.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon Dr PITA SHARPLES</strong>: I acknowledge the challenges of the Hēnare and Wright review in 1989, of the Charters, Sykes, and Nīkora review of 1991, and of the Māori Affairs Committee report of 2001. I think today of all the calls from beneficial owners who have been moved to place their submissions before Parliament, seeking to reform the role of the Māori Trustee. That has been a long time coming, since the establishment of the function in 1921. Moving to more recent times, I want to recognise the work of the previous Minister for his role in the preliminary stages of this bill—tēnā koe, Parekura.</p>
          <a name="page_2300"></a>
          <p class="a">But this bill is significant for one reason: this bill represents the first bill presented by an independent Māori Party. It makes for fascinating analysis to consider the passage of history that is marked this week in Parliament. Five years ago yesterday, Parliament passed the first reading of the Foreshore and Seabed Bill, and today the Minister of Māori Affairs, from the party that arose out of opposition to that bill, now stands to deliver on legislation.</p>
          <p class="a">This is a significant bill. It establishes the Māori Trustee as a stand-alone organisation, an aspiration that many people have had before this bill took shape. The bill changes the way that payments on money held in trust in the common fund administered by the Māori Trustee are determined. The bill is supported by funding increases for services to the Māori Trustee, which are already in place. These are all achievements that we are proud to deliver on. Delivering on expectations is a commitment that we take very seriously, and we realise that these expectations, of course, have a very long whakapapa to them.</p>
          <p class="a">During the bill’s second reading, members of this House spoke of the importance of the role of the Māori Trustee. One of the legacies of the long, sad history of past Government Māori land policies is the ongoing need for a Māori Trustee. We are very aware of the levels of concern that tangata whenua have expressed over the years about the different roles the Māori Trustee has been required to play in the management, and at times the acquisition, of Māori land. We acknowledge, too, that there are still some situations in which the beneficial owners have had considerable difficulty in being able to exercise due care and regard for the protection of their whenua. Some Māori land is so fragmented that the separate blocks are not economic. Land may be isolated, with no road access. The owners may have had to move away from it long ago, in search of work and a roof over their heads. None the less, this land continues to have huge cultural and spiritual significance to whānau and to wider groupings. Toi te kupu, toi te mana, toi te whenua—these three: language, prestige, and land are the foundations of te Ao Māori, of our past, our present, and our future.</p>
          <p class="a">The responsibility of the Māori Trustee brings with it, then, the investment that tangata whenua place in preserving the important connections between people and the land—between the tāngata and the whenua. There are some cases where the current owners may not be known, or may not be able to be found. Many of our people have lost their knowledge of their connection to the land of their ancestors. The demands of the modern world may have driven them to cities in New Zealand and overseas. So I stand here today, pleased to support the role of the Māori Trustee in ensuring that those sacred bonds are upheld. The Crown will fund the stand-alone Māori Trustee for a range of functions. Those include finding the owners of the land held in trust, and, where practicable, helping owners to move towards managing their own land.</p>
          <p class="a">One of the themes that emerged from the Māori economic workshop that I held in January was the real potential for Māori, and for New Zealand, if Māori assets were better utilised. This is one of the areas that were identified for further work following the Prime Minister’s summit on employment. Making sure that the Māori Trustee is a strong and viable organisation is one aspect of that approach.</p>
          <p class="a">In 2007, the Māori Trustee acted as trustee or agent for over 188,000 owners and over 111,000 hectares of Māori land. Following the conclusion of the review of the Māori Trustee, funding for the Māori Trustee was increased last year. This was the beginning of the end of a long and complex process that began nearly two decades ago and has included looking at many options for the Māori Trustee. Today, it is up to all of us in this House to finally bring this process to an end.</p>
          <p class="a">This bill will make the Māori Trustee a stand-alone organisation, able to focus firmly on providing high-quality services to Māori. The bill will put in place reporting
 arrangements for public funding. This will involve including the Māori Trustee as an organisation on schedule 4 of the Public Finance Act 1989. These arrangements reflect the Māori Trustee’s independence, while providing transparency and accountability for public money.</p>
          <a name="page_2301"></a>
          <p class="a">As part of the shift to becoming a stand-alone organisation, the Māori Trustee will need to be appointed in a new way. At present, acting as the Māori Trustee is an office conferred on an employee of Te Puni Kōkiri. Under the bill, the Māori Trustee will be appointed by the Minister of Māori Affairs—and I am very aware of the serious responsibility this places upon me, and of my responsibilities to beneficial owners. In order to provide continuity for the new organisation, the bill provides that the current Māori Trustee will become the new Māori Trustee for a term of up to 5 years. Employees of the Māori Trust Office will also be transferred to the new organisation. I believe this provides certainty for staff and continuity for clients.</p>
          <p class="a">The bill removes the potential for a differential between what the Māori Trustee earns from money held in trust in the common fund, and what the Māori Trustee is required to pay beneficial owners. Under the new system, account holders will get in returns what the Māori Trustee receives from the investment of the common fund, less a management fee where applicable. That is a key part of the bill. It means that the return received by the owners of Māori land that is administered by the Māori Trustee will better reflect the returns received by the Māori Trustee. The Māori Trustee will also be required to report to account holders on these matters. The Maori Trust Office Regulations 1954 will be amended to be consistent with the changes set out in this bill.</p>
          <p class="a">I want to place it on the public record that the reforms set out in this bill were widely supported during consultation in 2007. The bill was also unanimously supported by select committees. The bill implements much-needed and long-awaited changes to the Maori Trustee Act 1953. Once again, I would like to thank all the many people and committees who have contributed to this exercise, so we could reach this stage. The bill has attracted much debate throughout all of its stages, and most of it has been very supportive, complimentary, and helpful.</p>
          <p class="a">Today we will pass this bill, and we will have a stand-alone Māori Trustee. It is therefore with much pleasure that I commend this bill to the House.</p>

            <strong>Hon PAREKURA HOROMIA (Labour—Ikaroa-Rāwhiti)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> E tika ana i runga i te tū nei ki te mihi kau ana ki a koe e te Minita Māori. Tēnā koe. Tēnā koe mō tō kaha ki te mau ake i te tino take nei i tēnei wā. Nō reira, tēnā koe.</p>
          <p class="a">[<em>It is apt as I rise to take this call that I acknowledge you, the Minister of Māori Affairs. Greetings to you. Congratulations on your efforts to date in bringing this very important matter before us. Well done.</em><strong></strong>]</p>
          <p class="a">Labour certainly supports the introduction of the changes to establish the Māori Trustee as a stand-alone organisation, and we understand the importance of amending provisions relating to the Māori Trustee’s organisational form and financial accountability. At present, the Māori Trustee is an office conferred on an employee of Te Puni Kōkiri, but that is soon to change. The Māori Trustee Amendment Bill will establish the Māori Trustee as a stand-alone organisation separate from Te Puni Kōkiri. This will underline the independence that the people have sought for the Māori Trustee for generations. It is to ensure that the Māori Trustee is able to carry out the exact fiduciary responsibilities of the position.</p>
          <p class="a">The bill provides for robust accountability for public funding, by including the Māori Trustee in schedule 4 of the Public Finance Act 1989. This will have the effect of applying appropriate reporting and other accountability provisions for the Māori Trustee in respect of funding provided by the Crown, while maintaining the Māori Trustee’s independence. For years the Crown has financed certain activities, and there will be a
 clear differentiation now about where that ends and where the private aspects of the Māori Trustee start. The reporting requirements will include preparing an annual report, with a statement of service performance. The bill provides that the Māori Trustee will be appointed by the Minister of Māori Affairs—which I support totally—for a renewable term of up to 5 years. Further amendments will enable the new stand-alone Māori Trustee to employ his or her own staff, and to appoint a deputy Māori Trustee.</p>
          <a name="page_2302"></a>
          <p class="a">In the sense of forward thinking, this bill is about modernising and moving forward an important organisation that manages a very, very sizable amount of Māori assets. The bill makes changes to the way in which interest on money held in trust in the common fund is determined. The bill provides that the Māori Trustee must pay the amount earned by the trustee in interest less a management fee; that provision is quite specific. The Māori Trustee will be required to review, on a quarterly basis, the amounts paid in the light of appropriate market rates, given the nature of the common fund and the conditions under which the trustee operates. Together these changes underline the Māori Trustee’s role and independence, and enhance the trustee’s accountability for public funding, while protecting and furthering the interests of the trustee’s beneficiaries.</p>
          <p class="a">The real question asks whether this bill goes far enough. There are issues relevant to Te Ture Whenua legislation—the second part of which I tried to bring alongside this bill—and I again encourage the Minister of Māori Affairs to re-look at that and see what relevance it has in relation to his wish to build economic surety for our people.</p>
          <p class="a">There was a good turnout at the consultations we held all around the country. There have been several consultations with Māori in relation to this bill, on the proposal for the stand-alone Māori Trustee. Wider discussion emerged at hui about the possibility of the Māori Trustee taking more of a leadership role to promote Māori development. I know there is the opinion that Māori can be left alone to do their own thing, and that needs to be encouraged. But there are some fundamentals within what the Māori Trustee works with in relation to succession planning, through all that multiplicity of assets. A whole lot of assets are not succeeded to—firstly, because people do not care to claim them. It can also be because the assets are too small or because the people have moved off somewhere and are hard to find. My learned colleague Tau Henare suggested the other evening that we got Baycorp and the Inland Revenue Department to find out where those owners were; I am not too sure about that.</p>
          <p class="a">More seriously, it is really, really important to understand the differentiation between a customary asset, which is perceived as an equitable asset, and those freehold titles of Pākehā and other people. At the end of the day the accumulated strength, in the sense of small shareholdings coming together, is offset—and penalised at times because Māori have to pay market rates on the land. They pay the maximum for the valuation, which is really geared around the saleability of property, but the majority of those lands are never sold—never sold. That is an unfairness. I listened to Mr Hide formulating new ideas on the super-city council this afternoon, but this is a very, very serious problem for Māori because the productivity of those lands is huge in areas like Gisborne, Hawke’s Bay, Wairarapa, Bay of Plenty—</p>

            <strong>Hon John Carter</strong>: Northland.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon PAREKURA HOROMIA</strong>: —and Northland. They really add to the export numbers, yet they are penalised for being that valuable asset. I say to Mr Hide that I hope the super-city council will take a better look at that issue and be fairer. I applaud the super-city move, and if we get the three Māori seats and his sort of advice to make sure that that asset is recognised, that is a good start.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Hon Member</strong>: Only three?</p>
          <a name="page_2303"></a>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon PAREKURA HOROMIA</strong>: If there are more seats, then we will be more appreciative. Both the National Party, and its new ally the Māori Party, need to put into action the call from our people to encourage the Māori Trustee to take more of a leadership role in Māori development. Māori are feeling the sharp edges of a recession, and some of us cannot chortle about those of our people who struggle—those on a lower income or with assets not well used. I want to say again that the valuation on those lands managed by the Māori Trustee is geared against saleability, and that the majority of those lands will never be sold. Maybe it has come into the minds of Māori to sell something to get something else. Valuations have gone up on other properties, which are sold now at ridiculous prices, but our people get penalised. As I have said, now, more than ever, Māori need support.</p>
          <p class="a">You know, at the end of the day this bill is very important to Māori, and I commend all the officials from Te Puni Kōkiri and the Māori Trust Office. I commend the Māori Affairs Committee and I commend the Minister of Māori Affairs for having the courage to take this through. I further commend him to be seriously forward-looking and make sure he has a look at the second part that we were working on; I would be more than happy to help him do that.</p>
          <p class="a">The main change to the bill concerns the termination of the appointment of the Māori Trustee. As was said formerly, he was previously appointed by the chief executive officer of Te Puni Kōkiri; the Minister of Māori Affairs now has that responsibility. And the operation of the Māori Trustee’s account is a very, very important part. When there are accumulated funds and nobody knows where to send them, someone has to use a clear, forward-thinking mindset to get a solution generated; whether it is for those beneficiaries in iwi clusters or in rohe clusters, someone needs to make a move. The funds should not be left in the account just for someone to guess what should be done with them.</p>
          <p class="a">Section 19 of the Māori Trustee Act 1953 provided that the Māori Trustee’s account had to be operated only by cheques or other instruments signed by authorised officers. Section 21 of the Māori Trustee Act 1953 stated that the Māori Trustee gave authority to officers to sign cheques or other instruments. So all the issues such as that one have needed to be modernised and moved forward. As for money held in the common fund and invested in the fund, the select committee has recommended that the term “distributable income” replace the term “interest”, in clause 11 of the bill. The Māori Trustee Act 1953 had required that interest earned from the investment of money in the common fund was paid into the general purposes fund.</p>
          <p class="a">I certainly pay due respect to all of those staff members and the people who have given loyally to the Māori Trust Office—the management, and those of our people who have passed on. That office is one of the most tangible things that we still maintain and have control of, like our language. The land is our land, generally—the lot that was not flogged—and we can do something about the stuff we have now. There is modernisation, in the sense of ensuring that we lift the asset value to its capacity, but the main thing about the usage is that we can trim the operation down, ensure that owners are found, and ensure the assets are utilised. I will not say “better” utilised, because a lot of Māori assets are well maintained and well managed at the moment. The myth that everything is in scrub and bracken is starting to fade away. Our people are capable, and our people want to compete in this modern world, but—bear with me—I say again that it is important that the differentiations here need to be managed. But this is a good bill; I commend the Minister of Māori Affairs again, and the officials.</p>

            <strong>Hon TAU HENARE (National)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I too congratulate the Hon Pita Sharples, the Hon Parekura Horomia, the officials from Te Puni Kōkiri, and the Māori Affairs Committee of the last Parliament. The committee was chaired by Dave Hereora, and two former
 members of that committee, Pita Paraone and Mahara Okeroa, are no longer here. I congratulate them on their work in the select committee part of the process of the Māori Trustee Amendment Bill. Once a bill has been introduced, select committees are the engine room of Parliament. Select committee members get to hear the submissions and all the talk by the officials. So I congratulate the members who sat on the Māori Affairs Committee in the last Parliament.</p>
          <a name="page_2304"></a>
          <p class="a">I want to say to two Hēnares who have been part of the last 50-odd years of reviewing the Māori Trust Office—my cousin Denese Hēnare and my uncle Bob Hēnare—that it was a job well done. Bob Hēnare was an unsung hero and, sadly, is not with us any more. More important, his real name was Mita Robert Hoturoa Hēnare. He was the first Māori to be the general manager—as we said in those old days—of a Government department outside of the Department of Māori Affairs. He was, in fact, general manager of the New Zealand Railways Corporation.</p>
          <p class="a">To get back to the bill, I say that when it is passed, the Māori Trustee will become a stand-alone organisation. It will have better accountability in terms of the beneficiaries for whom it is looking after interest. It will be more transparent than it has been, and that has to be good for any organisation, whether or not it is a Māori organisation. The bill is the beginning of a forward-looking Māori Trustee. It tidies up a few things, and will not be a panacea for all of Māoridom’s woes. With all due respect to those who have shareholdings in Māori land interests, I make the point that a lot of us do not have any. A lot of Māoridom, like myself, who live and breathe the urban lifestyle, are not beneficial owners of any pieces of Māori land. I make this point too: I am not crying over it.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: The politics of envy!</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon TAU HENARE</strong>: Oh, no. There is no envy in those politics, I say to my friend. Only somebody who was born and bred in the streets of Ōtara and now happily lives in west Auckland knows that it is no good being envious of somebody who has something that he or she does not have.</p>
          <p class="a">We must now concentrate on getting the benefits that have accrued over the many years of the Māori Trust Office to those who rightfully own them. I say to the House that if we dare move to that old, worn-out idea of a Māori bank, then we are in trouble, especially if we propose to use the money that is in the Māori Trust Office or the money that has accrued to the Māori Trustee. I am still of the belief that that money belongs to those beneficiaries and/or their families. So before we go down the track of thinking that it is amazing what we could do with this $35 million clump of money, let us go down the track of trying everything to find those beneficiaries and their families. Although my colleague the Hon Parekura Horomia, the previous Minister of Māori Affairs, pooh-poohs my idea of using Baycorp and the Inland Revenue Department—</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Hon Darren Hughes</strong>: So do the Tories.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon TAU HENARE</strong>: No, they do not. We have not tried Baycorp or the Inland Revenue Department. It is no good to pooh-pooh the idea if over the last 40 years we have not tried it. Let us have another look at it. Currently, all we do is expect the Māori Trust Office to come up with a thick book that is full of names, which we then drop on the local rūnanga office, expecting those people whose names are in the book to walk in off the streets and say: “Well, my name’s Harry Walker and I’m here for my five grand.” It does not work like that; it will never work like that. As long as we continue this outdated, outmoded way of trying to hunt people down in order to give them a benefit—to give them what they deserve—we will never win.</p>
          <p class="a">I think the passing of this bill is just a precursor to some exciting stuff down the road. It is an opportunity for the Māori Party and the Minister of Māori Affairs to lay claim
 once and for all to a real bright future. We are here to help him on that journey—not just some of us, but all of us.</p>
          <a name="page_2305"></a>
          <p class="a">I want to take a little time to talk about the gestation of this bill, because I think I need to put it into perspective. We cannot all just stand up here and lay platitudes at the feet of the present Minister of Māori Affairs, the previous Minister of Māori Affairs, and the previous, previous, previous Minister of Māori Affairs.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Hon Mita Ririnui</strong>: Three times removed!</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon TAU HENARE</strong>: Yes—the Minister of Māori Affairs thrice removed.</p>
          <p class="a">This bill originally appeared in this House with another part, and that was where the Minister, or the Government, would take part of the spoils of the beneficiaries—albeit the interest on the spoils—and put it into a development fund. The idea may have been laudable, but the problem was that it did not carry the country with it. The problem was that there was not a full round of consultation. I think that that part of the original bill, the rest of which became the bill we are passing today, was a ruse for the Minister to get his hands on the $35 million. As I said, it was a laudable idea, but it is maybe not the right time.</p>
          <p class="a">Again I say that the passing of this bill is just a precursor to something that may be very, very exciting. There may be something we can do to give back to the beneficiaries what they truly deserve and what they can rightly call their own—that is, in any business parlance, a dividend that they should get back as, I suppose, recompense for all the years their land interests have been used.</p>

            <strong>Hon NANAIA MAHUTA (Labour—Hauraki-Waikato)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I am pleased to rise to speak in the third reading debate of the Māori Trustee Amendment Bill and to reiterate the comments of my colleague and previous Minister of Māori Affairs, the Hon Parekura Horomia, that we support the bill.</p>
          <p class="a">I want to pick up where Mr Henare left off when he was explaining some of the background in terms of Labour’s work on this legislation. It was always with a view in mind that we had two bills introduced in tandem with the broader objective of trying to improve and accelerate Māori development. That is a very important point. Mr Henare himself gave recognition that this bill is not the panacea for all the woes that exist within Māoridom, and I reiterate that. The context of trying to move the Māori Trustee office as a stand-alone entity should exist within an environment that is more conducive to accelerating Māori development. There are no two ways about that. People who have been following this debate could be forgiven for thinking that there was some confusion in the Committee stage about the broad parameters of our debate, because, certainly, Labour members were continually putting forward a futuristic context for how the Māori Trustee office could contribute to Māori development, and we were pilloried by the Government for that very perspective. But we still hold true to that.</p>
          <p class="a">The intent of introducing this legislation was to enable the Māori Trustee office to be a stand-alone entity—which was a very good move—to increase transparency and accountability for the distribution of retained earnings, and to look at how management fees were being apportioned. Those were all fine things to be achieved—including the provision for a deputy trustee—all good moves within this bill. But—and this is a very important but—it should be viewed within the context of other connecting bits of work to help improve and accelerate Māori development aspirations. Parekura Horomia, as the previous Minister of this portfolio, well identified that as a natural consequence of dealing with the issue of trying to find shareholders the solution may in part lie in reviewing Te Ture Whenua Maori Act. It may in part lie with the Māori Trustee’s office itself improving its opportunity to identify shareholders who have continued to remain unidentified. A part solution was raised by Tau Henare. He suggested we should look at Baycorp’s register to identify some of these unidentified shareholders. But I suggest to
 the Minister that an iwi register could be just as useful. Some of the reasons why many of these owners are not identified is that they have to succeed to their land and there is a cost to go through in that process. Is it worth it for them to go through that whole process? So we have to make those connections again. Some of the solution could perhaps lie in reviewing Te Ture Whenua Maori Act to see how it could better remove some of the impediments.</p>
          <a name="page_2306"></a>
          <p class="a">I also want to draw on some of the issues that were raised throughout the debate about the retained earnings of the Māori Trustee. Again, a lot of criticism came towards Labour for proposing that rather than just letting that sum sit there in abeyance, not being utilised at all, we should use it to accelerate Māori development. Let us utilise it to accelerate Māori development aspiration, pretty much in the same way that support was given to establishing the Kōhanga Reo Trust and the Poutama Māori Business Trust, and we have now seen through the passage of time they have had made a significant contribution in their respective areas to advance the aspirations of Māori to lift their opportunities and to support that broader ambition that we certainly have on this side of the House to improve Māori development. It is a good ambition and it requires a number of strategies to achieve that outcome. Again, I support all the endorsements that have been reiterated in the House for the hard work and effort of officials, of the clerk of the Māori Affairs Committee, and of the two Ministers involved in stewarding this bill from its inception to its final passage. Again, I urge all members in this House to view this as just one small step in a number of steps that have to be undertaken with a degree of urgency if we are really to arrest some of the difficulties that exist amongst many of our communities in developing unproductive land, and being able to lift and support our governance structures, governance training, and governance responsibilities of those structures in our communities, enabling greater partnering opportunities with the Māori Trustee office and other iwi entities, and the like, of being able to look at some of the impediments on unproductive Māori land.</p>
          <p class="a">I raised through the Committee stage the fine work that the Minister of Māori Affairs’ ministry is undertaking around the issues of valuation and the rating of Māori land, which I hope will help inform better the current Minister of Local Government, because there are inequities in that process. Sadly, I was not in the portfolio long enough to try to deal with that. The Minister already knows some of that history, but commencing this very important work within Te Puni Kōkiri with a clear framework that identifies the impediments to developing some of the lands that we are talking about, I think, will make a useful contribution to ongoing policy development in local government. I hope the Minister of Local Government takes account of some of those inequities, because on the issue of governance he has no regard at all for the contribution that Māori can make at a governance level to the quality of decision making on councils.</p>
          <p class="a">The real challenge is that local government is an area that affects the everyday lives of people. Māori make a significant contribution to the quality of life in many communities. Māori want to ensure that they retain the opportunity to have a role at the decision-making table. Auckland is a good test case, but, more important, councils recognise that it is probably better to have unproductive lands, many of which are in Māori shareholding, utilised rather than not. That is why, if we look at some of the best practice that exists in councils, policies in the area of rating of Māori land have looked to strategies more conducive to development rather than to constrictive strategies, which get low land shareholding. So there are a number of solutions that lie within the wider ambit of the portfolio of the Minister of Māori Affairs. I certainly would endorse any of the work that he undertakes in that regard, because it is all very important.</p>
          <a name="page_2307"></a>
          <p class="a">I would like to touch on the Supplementary Order Paper that was introduced as a result of the contribution that I made at the Committee stage. That was around the issue of clarity in terms of delegations between the Māori Trustee and the deputy trustee, certainly in the situation where—for the unlikely or unfortunate reason—the Māori Trustee may be suspended, so that there is some continuity in terms of the role with the office. I acknowledge the Supplementary Order Paper and think that that is a fine amendment to stop political interference in some of the important functions that are undertaken by the role of the Māori Trustee.</p>
          <p class="a">Finally, I reiterate and endorse the comments of my colleague Parekura Horomia on this issue, which he knows a lot about—I think he could have spoken for another 10 minutes. I commend to this House the ambitious aspiration that we have that the Māori Trustee Amendment Bill and a future bill that supports Māori development can be something that we all find a common ground on and debate robustly in this House in the future. Kia ora koutou.</p>

            <strong>Dr RUSSEL NORMAN (Co-Leader—Green)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I am taking a call to speak briefly on the Māori Trustee Amendment Bill. The Green Party is voting for this bill. We support proper clarification of the role of the Māori Trustee, and recognise the fraught historical and contemporary issues that tangata whenua have experienced around structures created by a colonising Government. We hope this bill will be a positive part of the jigsaw of justice, as opposed to a confusing status quo.</p>
          <p class="a">As a Pākehā on the outside of this issue, but with a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, I am supporting my colleague Metiria Turei’s view on the development of this bill. I would like to say one thing, inspired by mana whenua. Concepts and structures such as trustee, incorporation, land court, and beneficiary have been used to disenfranchise tangata whenua since the 1800s. The assumption is that Western instruments can liberate indigenous people from their oppression, but, in effect, they have operated to destroy collectivity and hapūtanga to benefit the few, and alienate the resources. As Moana Jackson and others have said, the name of names is the mother of all things. So with some apprehension we vote yes to this bill.</p>

            <strong>PAUL QUINN (National)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Firstly, I take the opportunity in this call to express my condolences and the condolences of the 2008 fraternity and the whole of the National Party to the Parata family. As members probably know, Hekia’s mother has passed away. Her tangi is taking place as we speak, and her burial will be on Saturday. So I think it is appropriate and important that we acknowledge that sad occasion.</p>
          <p class="a">I, like some of the previous speakers, congratulate the Minister of Māori Affairs on expediting the Māori Trustee Amendment Bill, on showing his stewardship in his new role, and on the leadership he is bringing to his portfolio. Although I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the previous Minister, my friend and colleague Parekura Horomia, I say that, sadly, he was unable to expedite the passage of this bill at the same pace that the new Minister has.</p>
          <p class="a">I will just explain the sort of pressure that my friend and colleague, the previous Minister, worked under. In preparing for this debate, I thought it appropriate that I go back to the first reading debate and Committee stage of this bill to make sure that I was fully informed as to how it came to this stage. It was interesting for me to note that this bill was introduced by Dr Cullen. He overrode the then Minister of Māori Affairs, took the floor, and introduced and moved this bill. I felt sorry for my friend and colleague because he worked under the enormous shadow of Dr Cullen, as we saw again and again with the foreshore and seabed legislation. Even the negotiations with Māori over the emissions trading scheme were led by Dr Cullen. That was the big burden that my friend and colleague Parekura Horomia had to work under. It is great that he can now
 come before us, released of that burden, and be able to show his true leadership. He is able to contribute much more and represent Māori in great capacity.</p>
          <a name="page_2308"></a>
          <p class="a">The second point I make, in terms of doing my research for this third reading where I canvassed the summary and the issues as to how we got here, is that, as both the previous speakers for the Opposition have alluded to, this bill was part of a much larger piece of work—a much larger bill. As part of that bill, the working title Māori Business Aotearoa New Zealand was introduced. The problem was that when the bill went to the Māori Affairs Committee, Māori Business Aotearoa New Zealand was exposed as being a little piggy bank. The sort of moneys that had accumulated in the Māori Trustee were going to be taken and used. I think we heard the phrase “party hacks” bandied around a couple of days ago. Well, there was no doubt in my mind that the Government of the day had every intention of creating this little piggy bank under the name and guise of Māori Business Aotearoa New Zealand and putting a whole lot of party hacks on its board—and I can think of some of them: Wayne Butson and Gregory Fortuin. Gregory Fortuin is on the boards of the Families Commission, Crown Forestry Rental Trust, and New Zealand Post. I tell members that every time I see this guy, Gregory Fortuin, he is mana-munching around the marae and the hui, trying to get to the front row. He never speaks, but he loves getting on to the front row and doing a bit of mana-munching.</p>
          <p class="a">The important thing about this bill is that it is focused on the Māori Trustee and its operation. It is not focused on creating piggy banks for our friends, lackeys, and hacks. The first principle to remember is that this is someone else’s money. It is not a slush fund. The Māori Trustee has accumulated earnings and accumulated cash that belong to specific beneficiaries. Under any public trust law—or any law of any land—money belongs to the beneficiaries. Because of the outstanding contributions of the Māori Party members and the National Party members on the select committee, the committee was able to pull back the purpose of the bill to the true fundamentals: to drag the Māori Trustee into the modern 21st century.</p>
          <p class="a">That was the fundamental purpose of this bill, and that is what the select committee said. It said that we should just focus on modernising the Māori Trustee, and that we should give it the capability of electronic transfers so that it does not have only the ability to sign handwritten cheques. The Māori Trustee was almost using a quill and blotting paper, as that was how it used to operate. But the select committee focused on modernising the bill and dragging its operations into the 21st century. That was first principles, that is what the select committee did, and that is what this Government will do in passing this bill. That is what the Minister wants: he wants to modernise the Māori Trustee so that it can focus on things like finding beneficiaries, administrating, getting better money, and getting better returns for the people.</p>
          <p class="a">I agree with the previous speakers from the Opposition benches that Māori economic development is important. Aspirations are important; we are at one on that. We talked about it throughout this debate on this bill, and through the first reading—not that I was here, but I read about it—the Committee stage, and the second reading. It is important. We will deal with that in the good passage of time under the great stewardship and leadership of the current Minister of Māori Affairs, who will take us forward and bring growth to Māori.</p>
          <p class="a">For this bill, we need to focus only on the issues. As a consequence, the bill is in two parts. The first part deals with the operational framework to take the Māori Trustee into the modern 21st century. There are clauses around independence, disclosures, and reporting. My friend and colleague the Hon Parekura Horomia has canvassed a lot of those issues. But he forgot the second part of the bill, which allows for the transitional arrangements.</p>
          <a name="page_2309"></a>
          <p class="a">It is with great pleasure that I offer my full support, and join with my National colleagues—and, hopefully, our Labour friends on the Opposition benches—in pushing through the Minister’s first bill. Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker Barker.</p>

            <strong>Hon MITA RIRINUI (Labour)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Otirā, kai te Minita tēnā koe. Kia piki te ora ki tō hoa rangatira. Kai te tautoko ake i ēnā whakaaro ki tērā o wā tātau kuia e takoto mai rā i tōna marae, tōna atāmira hoki. Me te mihi anō rā ki tōna whānau ki a Hēkia mā, a Herewini mā otirā, tōna whānau nui tonu.

          <p class="a">[<em>Greetings indeed to you, the Minister. May your good lady’s health continue to improve. I endorse those tributes to that particular kuia of ours lying in state on her courtyard and her stage. Condolences to her family—Hekia, Herewini, and others—and, indeed, to her extended family at large. We on this side of the House endorse the tributes expressed.</em><strong></strong>]</p>
          <p class="a">I take this opportunity to acknowledge the passing of a very, very dear lady from Ngāti Porou, the mother of Hekia Parata. She is currently lying in state at her marae in Ruatōria. I thank the previous speaker, Paul Quinn, for raising the matter. Certainly, we on this side of the House acknowledge her passing.</p>
          <p class="a">I also congratulate the Minister of Māori Affairs on supporting the Māori Trustee Amendment Bill and bringing it through the Committee stage to the third reading. The Committee stage was very interesting. Every speaker who stood in this House highlighted the need for change and identified particular benefits within the bill, which will ensure that the Māori Trust Office is a stand-alone organisation headed by the Māori Trustee. The bill includes all the technical amendments that are required to ensure robust, transparent, and accountable financial management systems. Also, Part 2 ensures that any staff of the Māori Trust Office do not undergo any negativity because of the change. In fact, from what I can understand from the legislation, the proposal, and the staff of the Māori Trust Office, there is no concern in that particular area.</p>
          <p class="a">Also during the Committee stage, interestingly enough, the former Minister of Māori Affairs thrice removed raised a number of issues for the current Minister of Māori Affairs. Those issues were also put before the previous Minister of Māori Affairs, my colleague the Hon Parekura Horomia, who introduced this bill to the House. Amongst those challenges was one to go out and find who the undeclared beneficiaries of Māori Trustee assets are. It is not a simple, straightforward undertaking. Tau Henare said we could get Bay Collection Agency to do it, or we could borrow Inland Revenue Department staff, who seem to be able to find anyone, anywhere, at any time. It does not work in this case, because, simply, the issues of unidentified beneficiaries that the Māori Trust Office has to deal with are intergenerational. They have been around for decades.</p>
          <p class="a">Unlike the Hon Tau Henare, I do not have a grandfather, father, uncle, or auntie who was a former employee of the Māori Trust Office or the Ministry of Māori Affairs. Like Paul Quinn over there, my father, uncles, and aunties were farmers. They were people who toiled the land. They were out on the land every day. They entrusted their undeclared estates to the Māori Trustee Office with absolute comfort. Well, that was about 100 years ago, and times change. The needs of Māori people change. My colleague the Hon Nanaia Mahuta highlighted what those changes need to be in terms of our taking a huge step forward. As Tau Henare said, this bill is not the panacea for Māori woes; in fact, it is nothing more than a band-aid. It is a band-aid for a hakihaki that has been bleeding for a very, very long time. It brings us into the 21st century.</p>
          <p class="a">Māori around the country who were part of the consultation round acknowledged the need for change. They acknowledged the need for change and for a higher level of transparency in terms of their being able to monitor the use of these assets. Although
 some of them are undeclared in terms of who the rightful beneficiaries are, some beneficiaries know that their assets are there but they choose to leave them there, and I can name a number of people in that situation. Several members of my family are in that situation—of course, we ourselves always claim!</p>
          <a name="page_2310"></a>
          <p class="a">My colleague the Hon Nanaia Mahuta alluded to the need to take a step forward from where we are now in terms of the Māori Trust Office. I know that my whanaunga from Ngāti Awa—actually, he is my tuakana—in his contribution to the House said that we did not want to set up a fund where everybody has his or her nose in the trough. Well, what a sad way to feel about Māori development; it is a very sad way to feel about Māori development. That may have happened in the time that he recalls, but I can tell him that under the previous Minister of Māori Affairs it did not happen, and under the current Minister of Māori Affairs it does not happen. The worn-out track that certain people from certain communities trod over a number of years to the office of the Minister of Māori Affairs, with their hands out and their briefcases open, was shut long ago. Now, when those people enter the office of the Minister of Māori Affairs, the simple question is “What have you got?”. They are asked what their contribution is and what the benefits for Māori people across the country are. Those people did not get any time with the previous Minister of Māori Affairs, and they do not get any time with the current Minister of Māori Affairs, unless they are very clear about what their contributions are. I do not want to name those people; obviously, some people here know who they are, but let us not go down that track.</p>
          <p class="a">I am glad to hear that the Minister of Māori Affairs is 100 percent in support of this bill. I am very glad to hear that, and I hope that in the near future he will bring off the shelf and give priority to the proposal to establish a Māori economic development arm of the Māori Trustee Office. Equally important, I hope he adopts the same attitude that he has adopted this afternoon in this House when it comes to Treaty settlements. The Minister of Māori Affairs is in a very strong position to make sure that all the hurdles and encumbrances currently affecting the passage of settlement legislation through this House are removed. He has the opportunity to make a valuable contribution by ensuring that years and years of negotiations and resource commitment are not wasted. As my colleague Nanaia Mahuta said, this bill when enacted should complement a lot of positive activities that are currently in place for Māori. As a former Associate Minister in charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, I find that approach to be—and declare it to be—a very high priority.</p>
          <p class="a">She also mentioned that over a number of years—and it had been mentioned by speakers during the Committee stage—very strong Māori organisations had been established using funds from the Māori Trust Office. That did not appear to be a concern at the time, because Māori around the country knew that it was time to make a move and time to take a step forward. Our Māori language being used on our marae, in our homes and kura kaupapa, and right through the education system started there. Let us not forget that. Let us not call these funds a slush fund when our people—everybody—made such a sacrifice to make sure that the
 kōhanga reo movement,
 the Poutama Māori Business Trust, and all the other initiatives were a huge success. But let us not stop there; let us keep going.</p>
          <p class="a">As Tau Henare said, we can see whether we can find out who these beneficiaries are, and after a period of time maybe we can tell ourselves: “Well, let us use the fund to promote Māori economic development.” The problem with Tau’s statement is that we have been trying to find these people for 100 years. When is enough enough? When can we sit down and say to ourselves: “Let us trust ourselves. Let us trust our people. Let us make the move. Let us take the risk and go forward—no more looking back, no more putting down our people, no more ngau tuarā and all that stuff. Let us throw it out; we
 don’t need it.”? I say to the Minister of Māori Affairs that we on this side of the House have made a commitment to work with him on these particular matters, in order to go forward. That commitment stands, but I will say it again: we have very, very high expectations and standards, which is what our people out there expect from us.</p>
          <a name="page_2311"></a>
          <p class="a">That is my contribution to the debate on the third reading of the bill. I must say that I do support it—I do not want anyone saying that I did not say that! Once again, I thank the members of the 2008 Māori Affairs Committee: the then chairman of the Māori Affairs Committee, David Hereora, who is no longer in this House; the Hon Mahara Okeroa, who is no longer in this House; Pita Paraone, who is no longer in this House; the Hon Georgina Te Heuheu; and the Hon Tau Henare. I thank all the officials who guided us through this very difficult legislation. I also thank all of those who came to the committee with their submissions to express their views for and against certain aspects of the bill. In closing, I say that there is no doubt that this bill has been thoroughly examined.</p>

            <strong>MICHAEL WOODHOUSE (National)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I will begin by adding my message of condolence to the Pārata whānau at this time.</p>
          <p class="a">I am absolutely delighted that the whip saw fit to allocate me a call on the third reading of the Māori Trustee Amendment Bill. I guess it is through opportunities like this that new MPs like me can come to understand and contribute to the debates on such a wide policy range. I am certain that a great many members—and we have heard from many of them—are far more qualified than I am to comment on the merits of this legislation. Nevertheless, I will do my best to make a contribution to the discourse with Hipkins-like enthusiasm.</p>
          <p class="a">The Māori Trustee Amendment Bill had its genesis in the Māori Trustee and Māori Development Amendment Bill, and it had two intentions: firstly, the establishment of the Māori Trustee as a stand-alone organisation, and, secondly, to propose arrangements of the statutory corporation to further Māori economic development. As has been elucidated to some degree by my colleague Mr Quinn, that part of the initial bill was a bit contentious and, in fact, created quite some debate when the larger bill had its first reading. I think at that time my colleague the Hon Tau Henare said that perhaps the bill should be called the “Māori Trustee Theft Bill”, so it was clearly quite contentious legislation. Wisely, the select committee, having considered the submissions, decided to split the bill into two.</p>
          <p class="a">This bill deals with the first intention of the bill, which is the establishment of the Māori Trustee as a stand-alone organisation. I note that the select committee, in its very carefully considered deliberations, decided that the changes to establish the Māori Trustee as a stand-alone organisation were important enough that that split occur and that the bill should actually be passed before the close of the forty-eighth Parliament. So it seems that this bill is yet another example of the bit of a tangle the previous administration got into when it was far more interested in policies that ensured its continued survival on the Treasury benches than on focusing on the issues at hand and the passage of legislation. I am pleased to be part of a Government that is taking appropriate legislation from the obscurity of the Order Paper where it has been languishing, and ensuring its speedy passage through the House and into law.</p>
          <p class="a">I think it is appropriate to focus for a moment on the second objective of that initial bill and why this Government and its confidence and supply partners are extremely concerned about ensuring that aspirations for Māori are met, particularly their economic development aspirations, because they are so important to the social and cultural strength of any people—but certainly Māoridom. There were certainly sufficiently challenging elements to that part of the legislation for it to be put to one side, but I look forward to this Government and its confidence and supply partners coming up with
 much more appropriate policies and legislation that will enable innovation, economic growth, and prosperity for tangata whenua.</p>
          <a name="page_2312"></a>
          <p class="a">The issue of Māori economic development is as important now as it has ever been, as we stare down the barrel of recession—the depth and length of which we cannot really determine yet, and which to a considerable degree is somewhat beyond the control of small economies like ours. We know that the tax-and-spend policies of the previous Labour administration, which it believed somehow contributed to strong economic performance over the past few years but actually acted as a handbrake when better policies would have led to stronger growth and a greater resilience to the downturn, were thankfully ended. They were thankfully ended by not only the general electorate but the Māori electorate who saw through those policies and elected parties to govern so that they could cushion the country through the harshest edges of recession. High tax and public spending will not end this recession. Education, innovation, entrepreneurship, risk taking, and increasing exports are the key to improving our position relative to other OECD countries. Rising unemployment is probably the most tangible and concerning element of recession. Previous recessions have identified that Māori are as vulnerable, or more so, as the rest of the population when considering the average rates of unemployment. Māori economic development initiatives must continue to be encouraged, as evidenced by the Māori development workshops that have already been held earlier this year and mentioned by the Hon Dr Pita Sharples. I look forward to the Government and the Māori Party continuing to explore ways in which this can be achieved.</p>
          <p class="a">The Māori Trustee, I understand, is also responsible for the administration of the Sir Apirana Ngata Memorial Scholarship, which was created by the Maori Soldiers Trust Act in 1957. I am advised that the scholarship funding comes from the Hereheretau Station in Wairoa, which is a major asset of the Māori Soldiers Trust, so I certainly commend the work of the trust office and the opportunities given to Māori students through that scholarship.</p>
          <p class="a">During the Committee stage my colleague Aaron Gilmore talked about the issue of distributable income and those who are and are not entitled to income. In particular he referred to the unclaimed moneys in some of the families from his area in Te Wai Pounamu who were entitled to, in some cases, considerable amounts of money, as I understand it, thanks to the amendments being made to clauses 11 and 11A. The entitlement to those unclaimed moneys will rise by the fact that all of the income from the investment of money in the common fund will be paid into the common fund and the distributable income will be paid out of the common fund, rather than the interest earned being paid into the general purposes fund. Mr Gilmore was strongly in favour of some of the families he described in respect of that clause. I support that view and look forward to that being the case.</p>
          <p class="a">One of the other significant things the bill does is to effectively write off the Māori Trustee’s accumulated debt to the Crown, therefore ruling out the need for section 41 and making the Māori Trust Office effectively Crown funded. That is not to indicate that the autonomy of the Māori Trust Office should be compromised in any way. The whole purpose of this bill is to crystallise the independence of the Māori Trustee, as in fact any trustee would. The basic principles of trust law in this country revolve around that independence. The legislation will more accurately bring the Māori Trustee into line with common principles, as set out by the trustee’s Act and its subsequent amendments.</p>
          <p class="a">I am very delighted to have been given the opportunity to take this call and spend a few minutes sharing my learnings of the day. I am proud to support this bill, as my Government will, and I look forward to its passage through the House so that the
 general level of accountability for the office of the Māori Trustee is approved. The Māori Trustee will be free from political pressure as a stand-alone organisation, and it will add to the communication between the trustee and its beneficiaries. I support this bill. I look forward to its passage through the House. I hope I have not kept Mita awake for too long. I will be very happy to support this bill. Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker.</p>

            <strong>TODD
 McCLAY (National—Rotorua)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> As I rise to speak on the Māori Trustee Amendment Bill I would like to recognise and pay tribute to Hekia Parata and her mother, who, very sadly, has passed away. Hekia, of course, is my bench mate in Parliament. I do know that Hekia’s mother was extremely proud of her, and if her mother was anything like Hekia, she would have been a very strong and capable woman. This is a great loss, not only to her family but to all of us.</p>
          <p class="a">In rising to speak on this bill I give a word of caution to my very good friend Paul Quinn, who spoke with great eloquence earlier in this debate. I want to caution you about the savaging you keep on giving the previous Minister of Māori Affairs, the Hon Parekura Horomia, on these issues. I think you should leave the previous Minister of Māori Affairs alone.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Rick Barker)</strong>: Would you please keep the Chair out of the discussion. “You” refers to the Chair.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>TODD McCLAY</strong>: My apologies, Mr Assistant Speaker. I think when Paul is speaking in this House it would be best for him not to savage the previous Minister of Māori Affairs in such a way. The previous Minister is committed to this bill, and he speaks with great support for the Māori people. It strikes me, when listening to him, that he has an open mind. Perhaps he has an open mind when it comes to issues about Māori people in New Zealand. In fact, his mind is so open on this issue that Paul suggested to me he could feel the draught from here.</p>
          <p class="a">I commend the current Minister of Māori Affairs, Pita Sharples, for the fast pace and big progress he has made in delivering this bill before the House. He is a Minister who is all about delivery. I liken him, using a rugby analogy, to a winger who has a bill under his arm and is charging down the sideline, when the members of the previous Government are still hanging around the halfway line, arguing with the referee and complaining amongst themselves as to why someone else has the ball—in this case, the bill—and is running off to score a try.</p>
          <p class="a">Tau Henare, another former Minister of Māori Affairs, spoke earlier. Indeed, it is my impression, having observed this bill in other discussions in Parliament over the last 6 months, that the new Minister of Māori Affairs, Pita Sharples, is probably even better as a Minister than Tau Henare was when he was the Minister of Māori Affairs. I know that members opposite will find this hard to believe, but he has been doing a very good job. Tau Henare was an excellent Minister, none the less.</p>
          <p class="a">In coming to the bill directly, I say it is very important legislation. I had the opportunity to speak on this bill in the Committee stage. When I went back to my office and was able to look at my speech and read it, I realised that I might have made an error during my discussion in the Committee stage. I referred to the Hon Nanaia Mahuta, and I think I might have questioned whether she was a good person. I have had a chance to reflect on that very clearly, and I know that she supports this bill. I want to say how much I enjoyed the discussions I had with her during the campaign last year in Matamata, and upon reflection I can say she is not only an honourable person but a very good person. I want to set the record straight on that. Of course, at the time it was not clear whether she was supporting the bill, but her smile at me now suggests that she will be doing so, and therefore I set the record straight.</p>
          <p class="a">What does this bill do? We have heard other speakers talk about that at great length, but I repeat that it establishes the Māori Trustee as a stand-alone organisation. Finally,
 after so long, all the fighting, the quibbling, and the discussions that went on under the last Government in relation to the organisation around the Māori Trustee will be set aside. The good news for the Māori Trustee is that not only will it be easier for the Māori Trustee to do his or her work but the Māori Trustee will be able to focus on the very important job of going out there and finding the people for whom he or she is entrusted with funds and with land, and of trying to deliver some of the funds back to those people.</p>
          <a name="page_2314"></a>
          <p class="a">The bill also looks at the Minister’s authority when appointing a trustee, and also—this is important—when the Minister decides to take away the appointment of a trustee. I note—and in the debate others have spoken of this—that the Minister must observe the rules of natural justice. When one considers the rules of natural justice, I suggest one realises that when the previous Government put that provision in place—before it was unable to deliver this bill to Parliament and pass it into law—it did not have the current Minister in mind. He is a man whom I do not think we need to remind about natural justice. But perhaps in the future, one day 15 years from now, this issue will come up. Let us suppose that one of the members opposite becomes the Minister of Māori Affairs again. It might possibly be the Hon Parekura Horomia if he is still here, as the Labour Party rejuvenates itself. Well, on looking at this bill, I see that the reference to the Minister observing the rules of natural justice is important. It suggests that politics will be left out of that; politics will be set aside. That will be a good 15 years from now, and observing the rules of natural justice would be a great thing.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Paul Quinn</strong>: He will be Prime Minister.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>TODD McCLAY</strong>: Does the member think the Hon Parekura Horomia will be Prime Minister? He would be a very good Prime Minister. I think members on the Labour side of the House will have a discussion on that. If they gave Government MPs a vote on which of the members opposite should become a future Prime Minister, I think that Parekura would get a lot of votes from members on this side of the House.</p>
          <p class="a">I go on to say that the bill also replaces the term “interest” with that of “distributable income”, which is very important because the issue is not just about interest. Funds come from a number of places, and I have seen a number of very wide descriptions. The sad news, I suppose, is that if we had left the word “interest” in the bill—so that when the bill is adopted it became part of the law—today under the new Government the return from that interest would be about 2.5 percent per year. That would concern a lot of people who have money invested, as opposed to those who are borrowing and who would like that, because under the previous Government the interest rate was probably about 10 percent. The return from interest would have been much greater then, of course, than it is now, and many people for whom interest is paid on the funds held by the trustee are not benefiting from those funds, at all. There is a very long list of people out there who are yet to be found, and who might benefit from the funds held there. There is a structured income from the investment of the money in the common fund, and that forms part of the common fund rather than being transferred to the existing general purpose fund. That is important became it means that the money will be held there in trust, and cannot be diverted and used for other things.</p>
          <p class="a">I think I mentioned the word “diversion”, and I have a $35 million question: what did the previous Government want to do with the $35 million that was set up there, under the Māori Trustee, for it to use? As I searched through documents earlier, I came across a number of statements from extremely honourable members of this House—members who are doing a great job not only on behalf of the Māori community but on behalf of all of New Zealand and all New Zealanders—that said a Labour Government proposal to take $35 million from the Māori Trustee to build a Māori economic development agency was just another way for Labour MPs to write cheques to buy back the Māori
 vote. That was one statement. Who said that? It was a man who has spoken very ably in this House, and who knows a lot about these very important issues: my good friend Tau Henare. Mr Henare went on to say that proposal was a blatant bid by the Labour Party to try to get Māori back on board, and that Labour was stealing Māori money to do it. Mr Henare said that was unfair and desperate. Well, I ask members opposite how unfair and desperate that is.</p>
          <a name="page_2315"></a>
          <p class="a">I have only a few moments left, and as this is an important bill I want to tell members a little about the research we were able to do before coming to the House today. I was able to get a list of people in my area of New Zealand, the Bay of Plenty, and particularly in the Rotorua electorate or Waiariki area. I have the number of people who are on the list of those who are owed money. I call on the new trustee, when this bill becomes law, to redouble his efforts and do everything possible to go out and try to find these people—not just to put out messages in a newspaper or on the Internet site but to actually look for an effective way to find them. There are 28 pages of names of people—1,400 people—in the Waiariki area who are owed money, and very large substantial amounts of money, and at the end of this debate I think it is important that we look at helping the Māori Trustee. I support this bill, and in a moment I will seek leave to table those names, so that the House has the very best opportunity it can have to help the trustee in his work.</p>
          <p class="a">The Minister has done a great piece of work; I commend him for it. I am very happy to stand up and to support this bill in its third reading. This will be a celebration. From 2007 to 2008 there was a change of Government and a Minister running down the sidelines with a bill. Today he will score a try, and that will be good for the Māori Trustee and for Māori people in New Zealand. Thank you.</p>
          <p class="a">I seek leave to table the document in front of me, which is a list of unclaimed moneys held by the Māori Trustee for the Waiariki area.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Rick Barker)</strong>: Leave is sought for the tabling of the document. Is there any objection? There is objection.</p>

          <p class="a">This week is a very significant week in the history of Aotearoa, because it is the 5th birthday of the arrival, on the steps of this very Parliament, of te hīkoi takutai moana—the foreshore and seabed march of 2004—when 40,000 Māori gathered in Parliament grounds after marching from Te Rerenga Wairua, crossing tribal boundaries, gathering strength every day, and uniting tribes in a way that had not been seen for decades. It was a week when Māoridom signalled its refusal to be cowed by the threat to steal its
 foreshore and seabed; when Māoridom finally realised the 70 years of loyalty that it had given blindly and willingly was being thrown back in its face; and when Māori chose to turn their backs on the Labour Party and turn instead to one another for support, and to the newly formed Māori Party for the independence that they had craved for generations. The Māori Party now graces this House as the very first independent Māori political party to be seated in the New Zealand House of Representatives. The Māori Party is proud to stand alongside the Hon Dr Pita Sharples, who is the first Māori member of Parliament in the history of this country to present a bill to the House as Minister of Māori Affairs representing the only independent Māori political force ever to make it into Parliament.</p>
          <a name="page_2316"></a>
          <p class="a">This is a historic occasion. For all of these reasons and more, I am proud to stand here today and to pledge the Māori Party’s support for the Māori Trustee Amendment Bill. To see how far we have come in such a short time, I decided to look through
 <em>Hansard</em><strong></strong> to see what the Māori Party’s other co-leader, the Hon Tariana Turia, was doing during those traumatic times surrounding the first reading of the Foreshore and Seabed Bill. The debate was led by Michael Cullen, Don Brash, and Winston Peters, followed by Parekura Horomia, Jeanette Fitzsimons, Metiria Turei, and Richard Prebble. I see that the Hon Tariana Turia then sought leave to speak, but her request was denied by the ACT Party because she had recently been dumped by Labour for refusing to bow to the dictates of the party hierarchy. The debate continued with Peter Dunne, after which Tariana Turia rose again and was denied leave again. So the debate continued with Nanaia Mahuta, after which John Tamihere sought leave for Tariana Turia to speak—a call denied for a third time, just like in the Bible.</p>
          <p class="a">I tender the thanks of the Māori Party to Mita Ririnui for his gracious and unselfish action—he rose to speak and offered to stand aside so that Tariana Turia could be heard. Tariana’s words rang out with a truth that time itself cannot silence. She said: “What has been taken away is not just tupuna rights, which Māori may have been able to establish. What is also under compromise is the right to justice in the hands of the court. We will not sit down and accept a compromise of basic rights, a denial of our tikanga, a belittling of our status as indigenous peoples … We will not be relegated to second-class citizens in our own land. We are tangata whenua, and we are proud of it. It is that pride and determination that will drive us in the next hīkoi to the ballot box. We can determine our own future, and we will.” If I might add—</p>
          <p class="Intervention">
            <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I hesitate to raise it because clearly this is a well-prepared speech that the member has worked on for some time. The problem I have is that it does not yet appear to address the third reading of this bill. I think we are getting a very interesting treatise on Māori representation in New Zealand—</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Hon Steve Chadwick</strong>: And rights.</p>
          <p class="Intervention">
            <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: —and rights—and the history of members in this Parliament on other issues and other bills. I think this phase of the bill is meant to bring together the debates on this legislation, but it is meant to focus on the legislation before the House, or at least give fairly regular passing reference to it. We have not had that yet.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Hon Rick Barker)</strong>: Speaker’s rulings 116/7 and 117/3 advise that members should “confine themselves to the general principles of the bill as it emerged from the committee.”, and I invite the member to address the bill in its general principles. The member may, of course, draw on other elements to expand on the points that he is making.</p>

            <strong>HONE HARAWIRA</strong>: Tēnā koe. Tēnā tātou anō. In reference to the Māori Trustee Amendment Bill, I say that I have gone back over this time to remind us all of the massive changes to this Parliament over those 5 short years, and to remind us that today
 is indeed a day when Māori can all be proud of the standing of the independent Māori voice in Parliament that is the Māori Party.</p>
          <a name="page_2317"></a>
          <p class="a">The
 Māori Trustee Amendment Bill affects Māori in many ways. It will have an immediate impact on those who have land administered by the Māori Trustee, it delivers on a positive future for landowners while respecting the legacy of those who have gone before, and it realises a deeply held desire by Māori people generally, and by the Māori Party in particular, to have the Māori Trustee become a stand-alone body. Throughout the debate on this bill many speakers have referred to the influence of paternalistic bureaucracy, a concern raised time and time again by the beneficial owners about the independence of the Māori Trustee from the Crown. We congratulate the Minister on recognising the desire of those beneficial owners of Māori land to be consulted on how the Māori Trustee can best meet their needs, and we recognise in this bill the foundation for ensuring that the Māori Trustee can meet its obligations to those beneficial owners.</p>
          <p class="a">This bill will enable the transfer of staff from the existing structure to the new stand-alone entity so that no time is lost in retraining, and it also puts a greater focus on transparency so that beneficial owners of Māori land can have a greater understanding of exactly how the Māori Trustee meets its responsibilities. The bill also puts to rest a rather clumsy and unseemly attempt by the previous Government to try to justify the taking of $35 million, which should rightfully go back to the beneficial owners, and giving it to another organisation whose trustees would have been chosen by the Minister of Māori Affairs himself. This bill provides for the appointment of a deputy Māori Trustee to ensure the new organisation keeps functioning effectively in the absence of the trustee, and it provides sound principles on how the new stand-alone Māori Trustee organisation will be founded and run.</p>
          <p class="a">The Māori Party supports the passing of the Māori Trustee Amendment Bill. We have every confidence that the Minister of Māori Affairs will ensure appropriate consultation in the appointment of the Māori Trustee, and we extend our best wishes to the group for a successful future. In closing let me not let this moment pass without offering my congratulations to the Hon Dr Pita Sharples and the Hon Tariana Turia for the leadership they have provided to the Māori Party and, indeed, the Māori people as we again pay tribute to the Māori Trustee Amendment Bill—the very first bill introduced by a Minister of Māori Affairs from a party chosen by, representative of, and accountable to the Māori people themselves. This is a huge moment in our history as a nation. Five years ago this week the Hon Tariana Turia said: “We can determine our own future, and we will.” Today we add the final words to that prophecy: “Indeed, we are.” Kia ora tātou.</p>
