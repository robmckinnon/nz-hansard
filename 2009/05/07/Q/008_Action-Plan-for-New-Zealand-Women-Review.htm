        <strong>8.
 </strong>
        <strong>SUE MORONEY (Labour)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Women’s Affairs</strong>: What plans does she have to renew the Action Plan for New Zealand Women when it comes up for review this year?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:52:12"></a>
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG (Minister of Women’s Affairs)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> The Ministry of Women’s Affairs is visiting regions around the country seeking women’s input on the progress of New Zealand women. I am waiting to hear the results before I make any decisions.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Sue Moroney</strong>: When did the Minister acquire both the wisdom and the arrogance to decide all by herself what the priorities are for New Zealand women, and why will she not consult New Zealand women, as the previous Government did when it established this action plan for women, which she has no intention of renewing?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG</strong>: I would advise the member not to bring predetermined questions to the House. I have just told the House that the Ministry of Women’s Affairs is visiting the regions and seeking women’s input into the progress of women before I make any decisions.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Nikki Kaye</strong>: Is the Minister satisfied with the achievement of the milestones set out by the previous Government in its Action Plan for New Zealand Women?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG</strong>: In the previous Labour Government’s action plan a target was set of ensuring that 50 percent of State sector board members are women by 2010—that is next year. What has been achieved is closer to 42 percent. Even with the capable Ministry of Women’s Affairs and a very passionate Minister, a miracle will be called for to close the 8 percent gap in 1 year. In fact, what is worse is that for the last 9 years there was no strategy in place to reach the 50 percent target. What happened the last time a strategy—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member will resume her seat immediately. Some of these answers are ridiculously long, and there is no excuse for it whatsoever. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] And there will be silence while I am on my feet. There is no excuse for ridiculously long answers.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Sue Moroney</strong>: Does the Minister know that an official from the Ministry of Women’s Affairs reported to the Business and Professional Women’s annual conference at the weekend that the Government does not favour action plans, and that instead the Minister has decided what the priorities are for New Zealand women? When will the Minister come clean—as New Zealanders prepare to celebrate Mother’s Day on Sunday—and admit that she is scrapping the Action Plan for New Zealand Women because she knows that the National Government has no intention of improving paid parental leave, addressing the gender pay gap, or reducing violence against women?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG</strong>: I doubt very much that that member would have time to listen to what everybody at that conference said, because I know that she gatecrashed the conference trying to coerce people into signing her petition.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Pete Hodgson</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am not sure whether it is necessary to submit this to you, but I submit that this is a very clear case where the question was not addressed, nor was it attempted to be addressed.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I have to be honest with the honourable member that I did not understand the question myself. It went on far too long, as well; I just pulled the Minister up for her answer being far too long, and the member followed with a question that was far too long and convoluted. I could not understand whether it was answered or not. I apologise to the member, but I had that difficulty. We will not pursue that matter any further.</p>
      <a name="page_14"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Pete Hodgson</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker; I hope I will be careful. Is it in order for you to suggest that the questioner rephrase her question in a more succinct way so that we can attempt to get an answer to it?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: She has the opportunity for further supplementary questions; I hope she will take that opportunity.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Sir Roger Douglas</strong>: When will the Minister abolish her department; if not, could she outline what benefits the department delivers?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG</strong>: I would have loved to outline the benefits, but the Speaker has just pulled me up for giving long answers, and it would take about a whole day. There is much to do in the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, and I am all for women and for championing them.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Rodney Hide</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I do not think it is in order to answer a question by saying that it would take too long to answer it. I think mentioning just one benefit would have sufficed for addressing that question. If we can get away with saying a question would take too long to answer, it would be impossible to get a question addressed.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: If I recollect correctly, the honourable member’s question had two parts. One part was answered perfectly appropriately, and that is all the Standing Orders require.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Sue Moroney</strong>: I seek leave to table National’s Mother’s Day gift to New Zealand women. It is its website page detailing its policy on women—there is none.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table a web page. Is there any objection to that course of action? There is objection.</p>
