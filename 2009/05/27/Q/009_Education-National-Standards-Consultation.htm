        <strong>9.
 </strong>
        <strong>ALLAN PEACHEY (National—Tāmaki)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Education</strong>: What recent announcements has she made about the consultation for national standards?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_15:06:23"></a>
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY (Minister of Education)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Last Monday the Government published on the Ministry of Education’s website the draft standards in reading, writing, and mathematics, and examples of the reporting to parents. Packs of the standards and examples of reports were also sent out to schools, educators, and interested groups towards the end of last week. The release of the draft standards and reports marks the start of consultation with the sector, parents, and
 whānau, with feedback due back to the ministry by 3 July.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Allan Peachey</strong>: What type of engagement is planned with educators, parents, and
 whānau?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: Last week the first of about 42 meetings was held with parents and
 whānau, and this morning the first of 14 education sector meetings was held in Paihia. I am glad to say that interest in the meeting was so high, with 176 registrations received, that we had to find more space. The ministry has also committed to sending representatives along to meetings of educators wherever requested, and as at this morning it has agreed to attend a further 12 meetings. The ministry will continue to receive such requests.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>: What consultation has she had with
 Māori education groups and
 whānau, hapū, and iwi about national standards, and what has been their advice?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: I and my colleague the Hon Dr Sharples have spoken to a number of
 Māori education groups about the national standards. A recent example was 2 weeks ago, when I met with all the iwi groups with which the Ministry of Education has a relationship, and discussed the issue.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: How many of them?</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: Between 70 and 80 iwi leaders were at the meeting. Their advice was to make sure we have a strong research basis before setting the national standards for Māori-medium
 education.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Catherine
 Delahunty</strong>: Will the consultation over national standards of literacy and numeracy include asking
 whānau, parents, and teachers whether they want individual
 school results to be published, and will
 whānau, parents, and teachers be told about the possible effects on schools of publishing that information?</p>
      <a name="page_18"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: Yes, there is a question in the consultation document about what information parents want to receive and how that information should be phrased. I look forward to continuing to receive from parents, and from some sector representatives, advice about what the shape of that information might be. As to the question around the damage that might be done to schools if that information were published, I have made it very clear that neither the ministry nor I will be publishing any information in the form of league tables.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Allan Peachey</strong>: What feedback has the Minister received on the standards?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: I am very pleased that the feedback from the sector so far suggests that many, many people in it are happy with what we have produced. I quote one example. The New Zealand Educational Institute president, Frances Nelson, said: “The ministry and Minister
 have worked on something much more robust than anything I have seen in the world at this time.” That is a credit to the extremely good work of the experts inside and outside the ministry, who have worked to produce the standards.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>: Is the Minister confident there is a sufficiently robust research basis to develop national standards for kura kaupapa
 Māori; if not, what will she do to ensure that the policy will be successful in
 Māori-medium education?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: I am advised there is a significantly robust research basis from which to develop national standards in kura kaupapa
 Māori. We have given the ministry further time to develop those standards, before they go out for consultation later in the year.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Does the Minister regard professional cooperation as being vital to the implementation of her standards; if so, does she understand that the publication of league tables would undermine that cooperation?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: Yes, I understand perfectly that professional cooperation is necessary for the implementation of those standards, and that is why I have been at great pains to involve the education sector throughout the development and consultation period. That is why I have also taken great pains to assure the sector that the Minister and the ministry will not be publishing league tables at any time or at any stage.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Will the Minister support an amendment to the Official Information Act to prevent the use of that information for the publication of league tables?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon ANNE TOLLEY</strong>: If that member wishes to put something in front of me, I will consider it. I reassure the member, who with his party is intent on scaremongering amongst the sector, that, in fact, this Government—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I have made no public comment on this issue. The Minister cannot say that.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I think the Minister has given a sufficient answer to the question, anyhow, because she has made it clear she would consider the matter that the member put to her in that question. I think it has been answered and we do not need any further information.</p>
