        <strong>12.
 </strong>
        <strong>PHIL TWYFORD (Labour)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Local Government</strong>: What reports has he received on the financial effect on ratepayers of the Government’s decisions on Auckland governance?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_15:04:56"></a>
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE (Minister of Local Government)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> The most significant report is that of the royal commission. Although its costs the proposal differently in some ways from the Government’s decisions, the model is still broadly comparable.
 The commission expected that these changes would bring savings with a net present value of between $277 million and $574 million. My officials have also carried out some very preliminary and high-level costings on the Government’s proposal for local representation, which themselves were reviewed by Treasury. The cost of implementing the Government’s proposal will not be significantly greater than the cost estimated by the royal commission.</p>
      <a name="page_17"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: What response does the Minister have to families in the North Shore, Manukau, and Waitakere, given that their annual water bills are likely to go up by 70 percent, from around $900 a year to around $1,600 a year, as a direct result of the Government’s decision to force volumetric charging for water on Aucklanders?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: My response is quite simple: ratepayers should not respond to the scaremongering of those who oppose better governance for Auckland. I could do no better than to point to the royal commission, which the previous Government set up and spent $4 million on. The commission showed that there will be gains in net present value of some hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Rahui Katene</strong>: Has he been advised that the regional Pacific fono held in Manukau on Monday night decided that Pacific peoples would support the hīkoi for Māori seats on the super-city; and what arrangements have been made to meet with Auckland ratepayers to specifically respond to the concerns about the Māori seats?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: Yes, I have been advised of that. The Prime Minister, I, and the Hon John Carter have a significant programme of meetings in the Auckland region to discuss the future of Auckland governance, and it is certainly true that the issue of Māori representation often comes up. Also, the Minister of Māori Affairs sits on the Auckland governance reform Cabinet committee.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Rahui Katene</strong>: What response will the Minister make to Te Tiriti o Waitangi Committee o Manukau City Council, which has recommended that the royal commission’s proposals for Māori representation should be reinstated and strengthened, and that Māori representation should be included on the establishment board?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: Certainly the question of the establishment board and who is on it is an issue still before the Government, and it is true that the Government did not agree with the royal commission’s proposal for Māori representation. However, it is also clear that proper engagement with local iwi and the new Auckland Council will be crucial for the new council to succeed, and the Government is continuing to work on this issue.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Why will not the Minister legislate to ensure that Greater Auckland’s water supply cannot be sold or contracted out to the private sector, when he is perfectly willing to legislate to tell the Auckland Council how to charge Auckland families for water?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: Unlike the previous Government, this Government is not about making local decisions here in Parliament. This Government is about responding to the issues raised by the royal commission, providing leadership on the issue of Auckland governance, setting out a timetable, and doing something else that the previous Government did not do, and that is provide a mechanism by which Aucklanders and others with an interest can have their say, through the special select committee that will be set up today.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Does the Minister agree that Auckland ratepayers have a right to know how much the implementation of the Government’s decisions on Auckland governance will cost them in their rates bill?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: No, they do not have a right to that, but they should know, and they will know.</p>
      <a name="page_18"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Has the Minister consulted the Minister for Regulatory Reform on the two local government Auckland bills, and is he satisfied that a thorough analysis of the regulatory impact of these bills has been undertaken and they will not produce any adverse financial effects for Auckland ratepayers?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: Yes, most days that consultation takes place. This is a very inclusive Government, where Ministers regularly talk and discuss matters. Also, we are absolutely convinced that this is the best outcome for Auckland, and so are the majority of Aucklanders. It is just a shame that Opposition members cannot make up their minds on the position for Auckland’s governance.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I understand we have come to the end of question time now?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: No. There are questions to members.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: No, before that.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: There is one more supplementary question from Paul Twyford.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Does the Minister stand by his comments to a local government conference in February that when one is planning a spend-up it is always a good idea to get the consent of those who are paying the bill?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
