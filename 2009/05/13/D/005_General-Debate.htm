          <strong>Hon PHIL GOFF (Leader of the Opposition)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> I move,
 <em>That the House take note of miscellaneous business</em><strong></strong>. The Government can run, but it cannot hide. Steven Joyce has made a decision that will result in the destruction of hundreds of people’s homes. If this decision related to Paratai Drive in Ōrākei, or to Remuera Road, there would be a tunnel, all right. There would not be any question at all about destroying environments and homes. That is what the National Government has decided to do at Waterview, and it has not had the gumption to make the statement on that in time for the matter to be debated in this House. Others will continue to talk about that issue, but I want to raise another issue in my comments today.
 </p>
        <p class="a">Very serious allegations were made on
 <em>Campbell Live</em><strong></strong> last night that Melissa Lee misused taxpayers’ money from New Zealand On Air to make party political videos for the National Party. That claim was made by a staff member who had the courage to front up, who was prepared to have her name released, and who was prepared to go on the television. She said that staff time and equipment that was paid for by taxpayers’ money through New Zealand On Air, some $1.2 million, was misused to make an election propaganda video for the National Party. If that is correct, it is a gross misuse of taxpayers’ money. Melissa Lee was invited to turn up and state her point of view, answer, or explanation on
 <em>Campbell Live</em><strong></strong>. She neglected to do so; she refused to do so. It is not good enough to answer that sort of serious allegation with silence. That is a matter for John Key, who promised this House that he would uphold the standards of his members of Parliament, to clear up.
 </p>
        <p class="a">A second serious issue raised on that programme related to a clear conflict of interest. Melissa Lee had been selected as a National candidate. Subsequently, New Zealand On Air gave her company, of which she is the majority shareholder, $1.2 million to produce a series called
 <em>Asia Down Under</em><strong></strong>, which included a specific episode on the election itself. Melissa Lee said yes, she had a conflict of interest, and she should not be involved in that programme. The staff member who went on television said that Melissa Lee stood behind her, watching what she was doing while she edited that very programme. When the staff member expressed her discomfort at Melissa Lee, who is a friend of Pansy Wong, standing over her like that, what was Melissa Lee’s reply? It
 was: “I’m the boss here. I can be anywhere I like.” That is a clear conflict of interest. It is absolutely against journalistic and professional ethics, and last night it was labelled as such by the expert in this area, Jim Tully. That cannot be tolerated. It is absolutely outrageous.
 </p>
        <a name="page_2439"></a>
        <p class="a">A third question arises about whether the video produced by Melissa Lee was declared as an election expense by the National Party, as required under the law. That does not appear to have been done. I invite the next National MP who stands up to categorically deny that that election expense was not listed. It is easy enough to clear it up; the National Party should do that.
 </p>
        <p class="a">There are three things: a misuse of taxpayers’ money, a conflict of interest, and it appears that the programme on the election was not declared as an election expense. Is this the high standard on the part of parliamentarians that John Key promised New Zealand when he took office? This is unethical, unprofessional behaviour. We saw it first from Richard Worth; now we are seeing it from Melissa Lee. This Government, barely 6 months old, is showing elitism and arrogance in its behaviour, and also a disregard for the professional standards that members of Parliament or aspirant members of Parliament should be showing. I want to know why Melissa Lee would not front up to answer that allegation. I want the next National speaker to stand up and categorically deny that taxpayer funds were so misused.</p>
