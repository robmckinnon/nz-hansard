      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>4.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon NANAIA MAHUTA (Labour—Hauraki-Waikato)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Māori Affairs</strong>: What steps is he taking to ensure that Māori have a voice in the Government’s decision-making processes?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:28:59"></a>
        <strong>Hon GEORGINA TE HEUHEU (Associate Minister of Māori Affairs)</strong> on behalf of the
 <strong>Minister of Māori Affairs</strong>: He, along with all other Ministers in the Government who share this responsibility, has taken great strides in ensuring that Māori have a greater voice in the Government’s decision-making processes. Great strides in this regard include receiving direct input from Māori communities, Māori organisations, whānau, hapū, and iwi, and also receiving input through the ministry’s network of regional offices, and through his direct contacts. On a more formal level, the Minister has this year convened a Māori economic workshop to receive—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is my understanding that when a Minister is answering for another Minister, as this Minister is, she should be answering as he would be speaking and not referring to the Minister in the third person.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Technically I accept the convention, but I think—[<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] While I am ruling on a matter, members will be quiet. The Minister made it clear that she was answering on behalf of the Minister of
 Māori Affairs, and I think a little latitude is reasonable. Has the honourable Minister finished her answer?</p>
      <a name="page_8"></a>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon GEORGINA TE HEUHEU</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. On a more formal level, the Minister has this year convened a
 Māori economic workshop to receive very direct input from
 Māori into the Government’s responses to the current economic climate. He has convened and contributed to a range of other forums, including the Drivers of Crime ministerial meeting, the Prime Minister’s employment summit, and the pending Treaty summit. With his colleagues, he has established a consultation process for the review of the Foreshore and Seabed Act. Across all of these processes, the
 Māori voice is heard by the Government, and it is included in and informs decision making.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Nanaia
 Mahuta</strong>:
 Supplementary question
 to the real Minister of
 Māori Affairs: does she stand by his statement calling John Key’s decision to cut the proposed three
 Māori seats from the new Auckland super-council—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Tariana Turia</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I do not think we need that member, or any other member, to imply that the Minister of
 Māori Affairs is not the real Minister of
 Māori Affairs. I think it is inappropriate.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The honourable Minister’s point of order is absolutely correct. The member should not be making that kind of comment when asking a question. I ask her to please just ask her supplementary question.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Nanaia
 Mahuta</strong>: Does he stand by his statement calling John Key’s decision to cut the proposed three
 Māori seats from the new Auckland super-council as institutionalised racism; if
 not, why not?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GEORGINA TE HEUHEU</strong>: The Minister stands by all the statements that he has publicly made in relation to this matter.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>:
 Tēnātātou katoa. Does the Minister believe that the level of cooperation and consultation that he has had with colleagues is greater than that which the Ministers in the previous Labour Government had with their
 Māori Ministers, despite those Ministers sitting round the Labour Cabinet table?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Dr Michael Cullen</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The current Minister of
 Māori Affairs cannot possibly be responsible for consultation that occurred under a previous Government. That question clearly has to be ruled out, under all your previous rulings on these matters.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The honourable member makes a perfectly valid point. I invite the member to rephrase his question to bring it within the Standing Orders.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>: Does the Minister believe that the level of cooperation and consultation in decision-making processes that he has had with his colleagues is greater than that which
 Māori Ministers in the previous Labour Government may have had with other Ministers, despite those
 Māori Ministers sitting round the Cabinet table?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Dr Michael Cullen</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. That question actually has not got round the issue, and, obviously, it is factually impossible for the Minister to answer it. I am quite sure that the previous Minister of
 Māori Affairs, the Hon Parekura Horomia, played a far greater role round the Cabinet table than the current Minister of
 Māori Affairs could physically possibly do.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>: Mr Speaker, in the past you have ruled about the issue of questions asking whether a Minister has a belief, with wording such as “What reports does a Minister believe …”, and questions seeking a comment or an opinion. In this particular case, the question is seeking an opinion about issues of decision making that come from the initial question, as well as about those sitting round the Cabinet table. In other words—[<em>Interrupt</em><strong></strong><em>ion</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Thank you, Dr Cullen, for those efforts.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>: The question I raised was about the decision making process of Government, and about which table the Ministers sit at. I am trying to work out the complication in respect of the question, because it was clearly within those ambits.
 First, it was about the decision-making processes. Second, where is decision making done in respect of Government? At the Cabinet table. Surely the question addresses both of those points, in particular for this Minister to answer.</p>
      <a name="page_9"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Dr Michael Cullen</strong>: I think the problem for the member is that he is stuck on the horns of an impossible dilemma. If he is asking a question about the role of the Minister of Māori Affairs and the level of consultation, then, in any case, it would be impossible for any Minister sitting outside Cabinet to claim that he or she has had more consultation than a Minister who sits inside Cabinet. If the member is asking a question about the role of a co-leader of the Māori Party, then I think we have by now established, without any shred of doubt, that there can be no ministerial responsibility for, or questions about, the role of a co-leader of the Māori Party in terms of consultations with the current Government. That is not a matter of ministerial responsibility, except, of course, for the Prime Minister, potentially.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I thank honourable members for their contributions, because it is a serious issue. Questions should relate to ministerial responsibility, and objection has been raised to this particular question. Te Ururoa Flavell is correct, of course, in that questions seeking opinions can be asked under today’s Standing Orders. However, the dilemma for the member is that the Minister to whom he is addressing the question is not responsible for relationships that might have existed under the previous Government. If the member wishes to ask a question that seeks an opinion, the question cannot include matters relating to relationships that might have existed in the previous Government, because the current Minister is not responsible for that, in any shape or form. I realise this is fairly tricky ground, so I invite the member to have one last go at asking a supplementary question, because I do not want to deprive him of the opportunity to ask a supplementary question. But it does need to come within the Standing Orders. I am sure members will be listening carefully.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Dr Michael Cullen</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. It might help the member, perhaps, if the question was phrased: “Has the Minister had an unprecedented level of input into Government decision-making?”. That would be a legitimate question, and we would be interested in the answer.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I thank the honourable member for his advice.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>: Does the Minister believe that the level of cooperation and consultation amongst the current Government is of a level that he is happy with, or does it exceed his expectations?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GEORGINA TE HEUHEU</strong>: The Minister of Māori Affairs is exceedingly satisfied with the level of cooperation between him and other Ministers of the Government. He is very confident that the views he puts forward in a number of forums are heard and listened to.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Nanaia Mahuta</strong>: In light of that answer, does the Minister stand by his statement that there is a tussle between the Government and Māori rangatiratanga, and when there is a clash, the Government wins and throws out rangatiratanga, even though the Minister did a deal with the National-led Government, and sits on the Government benches while the National Government is throwing out Māori rangatiratanga?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GEORGINA TE HEUHEU</strong>: The Minister stands by everything he has said publicly. In answer to that question, there can be no better reply than the Minister’s statement in reply to a question in this House yesterday: “The agreement
 that the Māori Party has with National is totally mana-enhancing. We agree to disagree and to not talk behind each other’s backs.”—[<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Order!</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon GEORGINA TE HEUHEU</strong>: I will continue the quote from the Minister, from yesterday: “We have an open, honest policy. We agree to disagree. We have done that,
 and at all times there are no surprises, and that is why our relationship is growing stronger every day.”</p>
      <a name="page_10"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Nanaia
 Mahuta</strong>: Does the Minister agree that the so-called mana-enhancing relationship between him and the Government is a farce when the Government has clearly refused to listen to the views of him and his party on the 90-day fire-at-will Act, the minimum wage, the foreshore and seabed, and, now, representation on the Auckland super-council; if so, when will he realise that the only mana he is enhancing is National’s?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GEORGINA TE HEUHEU</strong>: The answer to the first of the several questions that were asked is no.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Dr Michael Cullen</strong>: Does the Minister accept that given that the
 Māori Party’s views on Auckland representation have been rejected, but the Government has supported the provision of more money for the
 Māori Party MPs, the public might be forgiven for thinking that this arrangement is more about enhancing money for the
 Māori Party than enhancing mana for
 Māori?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GEORGINA TE HEUHEU</strong>: No.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Question—[<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] Could the House just settle down a little.</p>
