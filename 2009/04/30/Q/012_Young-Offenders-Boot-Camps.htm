      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>12.
 </strong>
        <strong>JACINDA ARDERN (Labour)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister for Social Development and Employment</strong>: Does she stand by her statement aimed at those who presented to the Social Services Committee yesterday that “Critics of so-called ‘boot camps’ have missed the point” and that they have “misled the public”; if so, why?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:47:38"></a>
        <strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT (Minister for Social Development and Employment)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> I certainly do stand by my statements. That new member may not realise this, but her Government spent the past decade missing the point for these young people and misleading the public about trying to stop youth offending.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jacinda Ardern</strong>: How does she justify her claim that groups like Barnardos, Unicef, and the Families Commission misled the public when their submissions on her proposed military-style training programmes were based on evidence, unlike the Minister’s policy, which is based on a political agenda?</p>
      <a name="page_12"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: Actually I did not say that those groups had misled the public. I said that actually the Opposition had and the media had, and that it was time the public heard the true story. I am not prepared to walk away from young people who need assistance to get back on track. Quite frankly, if we keep on doing what we are doing, their numbers will just increase. This Government will not stand by and let that happen.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Darren Hughes</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. We have just heard two answers from the Minister. In her first answer she said that she stood by her comments, and in the second reply she gave she said that, oh no, she was not talking about people in the original primary answer. She said she was talking about a third group: the media. How can those two answers be consistent—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member cannot use a point of order to question the quality of a Minister’s answer. Further supplementary questions are available to the member who asked the questions in order for her to pursue any inconsistencies she may see in the answers.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jacinda Ardern</strong>: How does she reconcile her statements with those made by the Prime Minister at the launch of Fresh Start that he would use “the most
 advanced expertise in youth offending and rehabilitation that New Zealand has to offer”, when experts such as Dr Ian Lambie, Professor John Werry, Professor David Fergusson, Principal Youth Court Judge Andrew Becroft, Unicef, Barnardos, the Families Commission, and the New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services have all spoken against her proposals and had their views dismissed?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: Actually, those groups have stood up for the mentoring programmes that this Government is introducing. Actually, those people have stood up and said that they support the parenting orders that we are putting forward, which will make a difference in the families of those young offenders. Actually, those people have stood up and said that they support the drug and alcohol rehabilitation that will be attached to these programmes, which will turn these young offenders around. Yes, it is hard, but we will stand by turning around the lives of these young people.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jacinda Ardern</strong>: Does the Minister stand by her claim that it was the media and not the submitters to the select committee yesterday that were misleading the public, when she stated in her press release yesterday: “The criticisms, aired by several groups at the Social Services select committee today, show fundamental misunderstandings of the Government’s … programme”?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: It sounds as though they misunderstood, not that they misled, which is the point that I was making.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jacinda Ardern</strong>: How does she reconcile her criticism of those who dared to express their opinions on her bill, which is apparently beyond reproach, with her own criticism of Government policy on Greater Auckland governance?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: I would like to make it clear that people are entitled to an opinion. It will not affect their funding, which is something that the previous Government held over organisations on a daily basis. They had to agree with the Government or their funding was gone.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Simon Bridges</strong>: What trends has the Minister seen on violent youth offending over the last 10 years?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PAULA BENNETT</strong>: In the years 1999-2000 young people aged 14 to 16 years committed 3,301 violent offences. In 2007-08 a staggering 5,029 violent offences were committed by this same age group. Under the Labour Government violence by 14 to 16-year-olds increased by a staggering 52 percent. We want these young people to graduate to a fulfilling life, not to a life spent in jail.</p>
