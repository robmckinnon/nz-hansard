    <div class="SubsQuestion">
      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>1. Hon PHIL GOFF (Leader of the Opposition)</strong> to the
 <strong>Prime Minister</strong>: Does he stand by his reported comments to Papanui High School principal Denis Pyatt, when asked if his Government had seriously underestimated the impact of adult community education cutbacks on communities, that “You’re probably right”; if not, why not?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:02:33"></a>
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH (Acting Prime Minister)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> The Prime Minister met with a number of school principals, including Denis Pyatt, last month, and recalls him raising the issue of community education and the effects of adult and community education funding decisions on his school. The Prime Minister does not recall the details of the conversation, but it is likely, he acknowledges, that some people have reacted adversely to the decision. He reiterated that the Government stood by its decision to ensure that education funding is focused on high-priority areas, such as literacy and numeracy, and getting young people back into skills and work.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Does the Prime Minister agree with his Minister of Finance, Bill English, who told the country that “School night classes have been a cornerstone of community education for decades, providing opportunities for learning and companionship for thousands of people. The system has been cheap and flexible.”; and did Bill English justify to him the double standards of believing that, yet slashing adult and community education by 80 percent?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: The Prime Minister has discussed that matter with the Minister of Finance, who pointed out that in the current fiscal environment, where the Government has to grapple with a very large Budget deficit, the Government needs to be clear about its priorities. It has expressed its educational priorities as being literacy and numeracy, and getting young people skills and back into work.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: If it is a matter of priorities, why is the concept of continued learning—everything from skills that help one to find employment, to community classes like anger management and parenting—a lower priority than giving $35 million of extra funding to privileged kids in private schools?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: In respect of the funding for private schools, the fact is that if those schools go broke, those kids will all show up in the public system, where the Government funding will be considerably higher—in fact, about three times higher—than it is for the private schools.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Chris Tremain</strong>: What statements has the Prime Minister seen that endorse the need to reprioritise tertiary education funding?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: The Prime Minister has seen some statements, and one in particular from the vice-chancellor of Massey University—who, I understand, used to be a member of the Labour caucus—pointing out that when the Government has constrained expenditure, it needs to make choices about priorities. And that will be the reality of the next 10 years, because it will take 10 years for the Government to get back to having a surplus.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Has the Prime Minister’s colleague the Minister of Finance explained to him why, after saying “The demise
 of night schools is bad for schools, for communities and for thousands of people who use them to learn something new.”, he
 has undermined a century-long tradition of continued learning through life and reprioritised the funding to high-income groups through private schools?</p>
      <a name="page_2"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: The Prime Minister did speak to the Minister of Finance, who reiterated that the Government is spending $124 million on adult and community education over the next 4 years.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Catherine Delahunty</strong>: Tēnā koe, Mr Speaker. Tēnā koutou katoa. Does the Prime Minister agree that adult and community education night classes were cut to focus funding on literacy; if so, why did the Government cut funding to Literacy Aotearoa, the country’s main umbrella literacy education provider?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: Those two funding streams are unrelated. Literacy Aotearoa is funded through the Tertiary Education Commission.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: How many National backbenchers have raised with him their view that these funding cuts are unsustainable, such as National MP Jackie Blue, who has emailed adult and community education groups offering to help them to oppose the Government cuts in this area?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: The Prime Minister is delighted that National’s backbenchers are in touch with their communities. That is the reason that there are so many of them here and the reason that the Labour Party does not hold a single electorate seat outside a metropolitan area.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Why are community groups like Youthline having their funding slashed as part of the 80 percent cuts to adult and community education funding, when Youthline uses those funds to train its support workers who do invaluable work and do it voluntarily?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: I cannot answer in detail in respect of Youthline, but I would make two points. One is that the Tertiary Education Commission has flexibility about how it uses its funds, and the second is that the Government has set up a Community Response Fund designed to assist non-governmental organisations that are affected by the recession in their ability to raise money.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Catherine Delahunty</strong>: Can the Prime Minister outline the benefits of adult and community education, including literacy night classes for new migrants seeking to assist their children with homework or seeking employment?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: Yes, that is one of the benefits of these classes. That is why the Government is going to spend over $100 million in the next 4 years on funding them.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Phil Goff</strong>: Before making the decision to slash the funding of those classes by 80 percent, did the Prime Minister or his Government consult with the schools, the tutors, or any of the 220,000 people who enjoy night schools to find out what the costs and consequences would be to them and the community; if not, why not?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: As the member knows, those decisions were made in the context of the Budget round. I do not think there is any lack of opportunity for people to express their views about that. That is self-evident.</p>
