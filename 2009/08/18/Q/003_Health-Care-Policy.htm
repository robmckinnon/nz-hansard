      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>3.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon RUTH DYSON (Labour—Port Hills)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Health</strong>: Does he still stand by his policy to deliver better, sooner, and more convenient health care?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:14:57"></a>
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL (Minister of Health)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Despite the fact that the previous Government left the health services delivering $160 million of services that were unfunded, yes.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: Will the Minister reject the proposal for the establishment of a national health board, or is he now prepared to admit that this is a broken election promise, with increased rather than decreased bureaucracy in health?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: The member refers to a report by an independent group of people from across the health sector. It has yet to be considered by Cabinet. But, look, I can rule out anything that will increase bureaucracy or not improve patient services.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: Will the Minister instruct Waikato District Health Board to unfreeze its cap on doctors, or will he concede that the promise to deliver more doctors to the front line is now another broken election promise?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: I first looked into this matter when it was raised with me 2 weeks ago, and I found that the so-called “cap on employment” actually referred to the level of staff in the Waikato District Health Board’s budget. This year the district health
 board is forecasting to have more clinical staff than last year, including more doctors, nurses, and allied health staff. However, it is endeavouring to ensure that recruitment focuses on areas of understaffing such as mental health. I have been assured that the district health board has made no suggestion to make clinical staff redundant. That is because we have increased its funding by $54 million.</p>
      <a name="page_4"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jo Goodhew</strong>: What responses has the Minister seen in relation to the public release of the ministerial review group report?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: I have received a number of items of feedback to the independent report. The <em>New Zealand Herald</em><strong></strong> said the
 “Minister must move fast on health reform”, and that “These are not radical suggestions,”. The
 Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners said “It is about providing the right care in the right place at the right time by the right person, and this report acknowledges the importance of this approach.” The Public Health Association of New Zealand welcomed the renewed focus on quality as a way to reduce health inequalities.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: Will the Minister now apologise to the people of Dunstan in Central Otago for his broken election promise to them, given the reduction in physiotherapy and disability home support, both of which are front-line services provided in their area?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: I would say to the people of Dunstan that they should have a look at a report that I am holding here, because I am surprised that the previous Associate Minister of Health was silent on this issue when her Government approved cuts to aged-care services in Wanganui, for example. In 2006 her Government agreed that Whanganui District Health Board had to take fairly swift action, resulting in individuals with lower levels of need being reassessed, services removed, and access criteria tightened, and there was not a word from that member.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Ruth Dyson</strong>: Will the Minister now apologise to the older people of Canterbury for his broken promise to them, given the reduction in both home support services and access to rest home care?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: I visited Christchurch Hospital last week and had an opportunity to speak to over 300 doctors, nurses, and students. I am advised that Canterbury District Health Board has not reduced funding for aged residential care, and it does not expect to reduce the number of residential care beds. The district health board is also refocusing its services on providing home support for people with higher levels of need. Its spending on health for older people will increase by $5 million this year. I suspect if one behaves like the Opposition spokesperson on health by reading one table that says there is a cut, when actually there is an increase, one could get confused by that information.
 </p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jo Goodhew</strong>: What reports has the Minister seen about district health boards and their decisions about how they allocate their funds in relation to services?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: I have seen a range of reports about the need for district health boards to live within their means. I have seen statements from Dr Cullen and the previous Minister of Health. But as I have said before, the most interesting statement was made in July 2004 by the Associate Minister of Health, who was defending claims of negligence from the Wellington City Mission over funding cuts for aged care. The then Associate Minister of Health said that how health boards allocate funding was not her responsibility. That Associate Minister of Health was Ruth Dyson.</p>
