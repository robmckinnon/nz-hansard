      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>11.
 </strong>
        <strong>PHIL TWYFORD (Labour)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Local Government</strong>: Are there any issues other than Māori representation in local government that he believes are matters of principle and therefore worth resigning over?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_15:14:08"></a>
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE (Minister of Local Government)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> No.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Will the Minister extend the Wanganui District Council (Prohibition of Gang Insignia) Act to all of New Zealand on account of the Prime Minister’s new rule that local government legislation must apply to all councils across the country?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: I fail to see what possible ministerial responsibility I would have for that.</p>
      <a name="page_13"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am sorry to interrupt my friend, but we all know that the Wanganui bill was a local bill affecting only one local authority in the country. How can it be other than within the Minister’s responsibility to answer that question?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I think the honourable member has answered his own question that he posed with that point of order, in that it is a
 private bill and not a bill for which any Minister has responsibility.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon David Parker</strong>: It was brought to this House by way of a local bill, but it is a matter of public policy for which that member has responsibility in this Government. As
 you have already said,
 there is
 no matter of public policy for which the Government does not have responsibility. Who else within Government would have responsibility for that issue?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: As Speaker, it was my assessment that the Minister responded reasonably in that he said he had no responsibility for it. At the end of the day, that is the end of the matter as far as the Speaker is concerned. The Speaker cannot second-guess a Minister, as to a Minister’s ministerial responsibility. Had it been put down as a primary question, I would have wanted to see the matter of ministerial responsibility sorted out. But, as it has been asked as a supplementary question, and the Minister has indicated he has no responsibility for that matter, that is the end of the matter as far as the Speaker is concerned.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Is it a matter of principle for the Minister to keep secret from the public his threat to resign, when at the same time advocating openness and transparency in local government?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: Yes, it is. Let me explain. The Prime Minister approached me about what my position would be if such a compromise was possible between the National Party and the Māori Party, and I said that the numbers would work for that in the House, obviously, but I could not have my name on such legislation, and I would have to stand aside if Cabinet and then the Parliament decided that that would be the result in that legislation. I did not allow that to affect the decision to Cabinet because it was only a conversation between the Prime Minister and me. I did advise my caucus and my board of the discussion, and received their full support.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: How does he reconcile his comment: “we want people to get involved in determining the future of our region. We do understand that politicians aren’t the font of all wisdom—” with his decision to substitute his own opinion on Māori representation for that of the recommendations of the royal commission, which received over 3,500 submissions and the majority of submissions on this issue to the select committee?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: Very easily, because at the end of the day I am only one vote in this House, and what I was—[<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>:
 Order!</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: It is a bit difficult, Mr Speaker; the member asked a question and I am answering it. At the end of the day I am only one vote in this House, and the ACT Party is five votes. Ultimately, it is going to be a decision of the Parliament and Cabinet, and I was happy to accept that. What I did say was that because the legislation was in my name, I would have to take responsibility for that legislation—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Darren Hughes</strong>: And it’s all about you.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: No, it is not all about me. What it is about is the ACT Party having a philosophy and a principle that says there should be one vote for all and every position of political power open to a free contest. If it was the will of Parliament or Cabinet to say otherwise, I would have no option but to stand down. I assured the Prime Minister that the support of the five MPs would be for this Government because that
 was our agreement before the election, and we have stuck to our word. In fact, the only cost in the decision of standing aside would be to myself and to the ACT Party.</p>
