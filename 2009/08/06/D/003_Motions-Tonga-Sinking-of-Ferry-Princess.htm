            <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH (Deputy Prime Minister)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I seek leave to move a motion without notice relating to the tragedy in Tonga.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Is there any objection to that course being followed? There is none.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: I move,
 <em>That this Parliament express its sympathy and concern to the people of Tonga as search and rescue efforts continue following an overnight ferry sinking.</em><strong></strong> The ferry, the
 <em>Princess Ashika</em><strong></strong>, was sailing for the Ha‘apai group of islands in northern Tonga when it sank earlier today. An estimated 82 passengers and crew were on board. The cause of the sinking is not yet known. Rescuers so far have found 56 survivors. Two Orions, a Tongan Navy vessel, and other ships are searching the area for those missing, although the exact number of people on the ferry has not been confirmed.</p>
          <p class="a">New Zealand shares a close and longstanding relationship with Tonga, and a delegation of New Zealanders, led by the Prime Minister, visited Tonga only last month. We are offering our full support to Tonga following this tragic event. Two RNZAF Orions are assisting with the search for survivors, and the New Zealand authorities are in close touch with Tongan officials in case further support can be provided. New Zealand’s Rescue Coordination Centre in Wellington is coordinating the search, which is centred about 86 kilometres off Tonga’s capital, Nuku‘alofa. New Zealand officials will also help provide any support that may be required to maintain interim services following the loss of the vessel.</p>
          <a name="page_5528"></a>
          <p class="a">We are deeply concerned about those still missing, but we are informed that the rescue conditions are good, and our hopes remain high that more survivors will be found. At this difficult time our hearts go out to those in Tonga dealing directly with this tragedy, but also to the members of our own large and respected Tongan community in New Zealand, who will be deeply concerned.</p>

            <strong>Hon CHRIS CARTER (Labour—Te Atatū)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> On behalf of the Labour Party I rise to support the Government’s motion, that the hearts, minds, and the helping hands of New Zealanders go out to Tonga at this difficult time. We in the Labour Party are delighted that the Government has sent two Orion search aircraft to the area of northern Tonga, near Nomuka Island where the 26 people who are still missing are being searched for. We are delighted that New Zealand is able to also assist through the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand here in Wellington, which is coordinating the search for those missing people. We are also very pleased that Prime Minister Key spoke to Hon Dr Fred Sevele, the Tongan Prime Minister, in Cairns just a short time ago, expressing the sympathy and support of all New Zealanders.</p>
          <p class="a">We have a large and very respected Tongan community in New Zealand, and there will be Tongan Kiwis who have family connections to some of the people who are missing at the moment, lost at sea. They have been lost at sea for over 14 hours now, so this is an extraordinarily concerning time for the families and friends of those who are still missing. I am sure I speak on behalf of all New Zealanders when I say ‘oku faka folau atu ‘emau lotu mo ‘emau ‘ofa lolotonga ‘a e taimi faingata‘a ko eni.” In the Tongan language that means: “Our hearts are with you at this difficult time.”</p>

            <strong>Dr RUSSEL NORMAN (Co-Leader—Green)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I stand on behalf of the Green Party. The Green Party wishes to express its sorrow for those who may have lost their lives. We wish to express our sympathy to their families and to the extended Tongan community in New Zealand, whose members are no doubt feeling strongly about the tragedy. We also wish to express our hope—our hope that those who are still missing are found and rescued quickly.</p>

            <strong>Hon HEATHER ROY (Deputy Leader—ACT)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I stand on behalf of the ACT Party to support the Government’s motion, and, along with other parties, to express our concern about this tragedy that has taken place, and to extend it to those who are involved in the sinking of the
 <em>Princess Ashika</em><strong></strong> off the coast of Tonga just before 11 o’clock last night. Twenty-six people, I understand, are still unaccounted for, with around 42 people having been rescued from life rafts. The New Zealand Maritime Operations Centre picked up the mayday call late last night, soon after it was released, and the New Zealand Defence Force has sent two Orions, as has been mentioned. The first was deployed from Whenuapai just after 2.30 a.m. this morning, after a request from the Rescue Coordination Centre, and the second Orion departed early this morning to relieve the first Orion’s efforts. New Zealand’s search and rescue obligations cover a huge part of the South Pacific, and Tonga is of course part of the area that we are responsible for. The ACT Party joins other parties in this House in saying our hearts, thoughts, and prayers go out to the Tongans and to the Tongan community here in New Zealand.</p>

            <strong>:</strong> ‘Oku oatu ‘ku ‘ofa ki he kakai tonga kotoa pe he faingata‘a kuo hoko. I greet the people of Tonga on this sad day. Kei te pōuri te ngākau i tēnei wā. The Māori Party stands with all other parties to express our sympathies for the families who are grieving today after the tragedy that took place last night in the waters of the Pacific. Our connections as tangata w’enua with the peoples of Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa bind us together in times of happiness and in times of sadness. We think of those families with loved ones still missing and we offer our prayers. We also acknowledge the efforts of the New Zealand Rescue Coordination
 Centre, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and the maritime radio team, who have worked so valiantly to restore calm in this time of distress. Your courage in times of crisis will be remembered. May God bless you all.</p>

            <strong>Hon PETER DUNNE (Leader—United Future)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Yesterday a ferry that had recently been refitted set sail on a routine voyage between two of the islands in Tonga. Today we woke to the news of that ferry’s sinking, with some 82 people on board, and already 26 unaccounted for. The enormity of that potential tragedy comes home to us when we reflect on how mundane the circumstances were—a routine journey with those adverse consequences. Like others my heart goes out to the people of Tonga, and to the Tongan community in New Zealand, as they come to grips with the loss and the awful period of anxiety as they wait for the news of loved ones who may be at risk. My hope is that the good news of the fact that no corpses or wreckage have yet been found bodes well in terms of the survivors who are still unaccounted for. I acknowledge the work of our defence forces and the Rescue Coordination Centre in overseeing this exercise, and I hope it comes to a successful conclusion for the benefit of all concerned.</p>
