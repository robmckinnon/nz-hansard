        <strong>4.
 </strong>
        <strong>RAHUI KATENE (Māori Party—Te Tai Tonga)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister for Climate Change Issues</strong>: What advice has he received from the National Hui held by the Climate Change Iwi Leadership Group and the Māori reference group executive, on the Government’s climate change emissions target for 2020?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:40:40"></a>
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH (Minister for Climate Change Issues)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> A hui was held on the 2020 target at Hopuhopu in July, at which I appreciated the
 Māori Party’s presence and support. A further hui was held this week in Wellington. The advice I have received from the Climate Change Iwi Leadership Group and the
 Māori reference group executive has been very constructive. Whereas environmental groups have promoted very ambitious targets, and business groups very cautious ones,
 Māori have a strong environmental and economic interest, and, like the Government, are seeking a balanced outcome. I will be reporting their recommendations to Cabinet.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Rahui Katene</strong>: What has been the feedback from
 Māori about the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that to avoid dangerous climate change developed countries need to meet at least a 25 percent reduction by 2020, and how will he ensure there is continued consultation and representation with
 Māori on emissions reductions?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: The feedback I have had from
 Māori has been very balanced. They recognise the seriousness of climate change, as well as the difficulty of reducing emissions when such a large proportion of New Zealand’s emissions come from agriculture. I think we also have to recognise that the
 Māori economy is very strongly focused around forestry, around fishing, and around agriculture, and that poses some quite unique challenges, not just for
 Māori but for New Zealand.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Nanaia
 Mahuta</strong>: Can the Minister confirm that the
 Māori reference group has expressed concern at the Government’s economic modelling, and that it would be commissioning another more comprehensive report, for release before the end of the year; if so, what does this say about the level of confidence that
 Māori can have in the Government’s understanding of how climate change measures will affect them?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: I met with the
 Māori iwi leaders’ reference group on climate change. They expressed to me strong support for the Government’s approach around that difficult issue. They expressed no concern to me about the quality of the economic analysis that they themselves commissioned from Infometrics and from the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research. It might be helpful, too, for me to table
 for members that economic analysis of the effects of climate change on
 Māori, and I would be happy to do that.</p>
      <a name="page_11"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Rahui Katene</strong>: Has the Minister seen any reports on the likely impacts of different 2020 emission reduction scenarios on the
 Māori economy; if so, what were the main findings?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: Yes, I have seen the report that was jointly commissioned with the iwi leaders’ reference group and the Government. It does rightly identify in respect of the
 Māori economy and their large investment in agriculture, in forestry, and in fishing that the economic impacts for them are significant. I also note that the report’s overall conclusion is that the impacts of climate change policy and an emissions trading scheme are very similar for
 Māori and for other New Zealanders.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hekia Parata</strong>: E te Mana
 Whakawā,
 tēnātātou e te Whare. How significant to
 Māori are the international rules around carbon embedded in timber products and those in respect of flexible land use, and given their significance to
 Māori, is the Minister considering a senior
 Māori representative being part of the delegation to Copenhagen?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: The rules around forestry are of huge significance to
 Māori, particularly since the Central North Island Iwi Collective settlement that involved the largest plantation forest in the southern hemisphere. The conversion of pre-1990 forestry under current rates, which are about 800 tons per hectare, would mean that across
 Maori’s 439,000 hectares of trees, this issue amounts to a question of over $9 billion. An agreement that allowed offset planting would hugely reduce that liability. The rules around embedded carbon in timber products are also very significant, in that it would recognise the 25 percent of wood that goes into stored products. That further provides opportunities for
 Māori and substantial players in the forestry sector. I am favourably disposed to the request for
 Māori senior representation at the climate conference in Copenhagen, but the Cabinet has not decided the make-up of the New Zealand delegation.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Charles Chauvel</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am really just seeking your guidance. The Minister offered to table the economic analysis, which certainly members on this side of the House would like to see. Is there a—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: If he quoted from an official document, members can seek leave to have him table it, but I suspect that the Minister will seek leave.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Dr Nick Smith</strong>: I formerly seek leave to table the report from the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research and Infometrics on the effects of 2020 targets on the
 Māori economy.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that document. Is there any objection? There is none.</p>
      <ul class="">
        <li>Document, by leave, laid on the Table of the House.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: I seek leave to table a letter received today from Metro Water employees expressing concern about the release of their personal information to Watercare Services, as part of the transition to the new water monopoly in Auckland.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought to table that document. Is there any objection? There is no objection. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] I will put the question again. Leave is sought to table that document. Please make your objection loudly. Is there any objection? There is no objection.</p>
