    <div class="SubsQuestion">
      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>2.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon ANNETTE KING (Deputy Leader—Labour)</strong> to the
 <strong>Prime Minister</strong>: Does he agree with the reported comments attributed to Hon Tau Henare on the issue of Māori representation in Auckland that “I believe the issue is too far-reaching and too important for a party presently sitting at 1 percent in the polls to decide alone.”?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:09:42"></a>
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL (Minister of Health)</strong> on behalf of the
 <strong>Prime Minister</strong>: Yes, because under MMP no party alone has ever been able to decide the position on any issue that goes through this House in legislation. Issues require consultation and negotiation.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: Will there be Māori seats on the Auckland super-city council as the Māori Party demands, or no Māori seats on the Auckland super-city council as the ACT Party demands, or has the Prime Minister, as the acclaimed deal maker, found a compromise position, which is something he hinted at recently?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: We are currently working through the arrangements relating to the reorganisation of Greater Auckland local governance, and decisions will be made in due course.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: What compromise position is possible between two warring factions of the Prime Minister’s multiparty Government when his parliamentary colleague the Hon Tau Henare said there had been “a distinct lack
 of political will.” in trying to resolve the issue and the schism that has emerged among the minor parties propping up the Government?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: The National-led Government has a strong relationship with its support partners. We speak with them regularly on all sorts of issues. They are certainly the first cabs off the rank. But differences of opinion are not unusual. I ask the member to look at the opinions of her own party members, not only on this issue but also on her party leadership.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Sue Bradford</strong>: Does the Prime Minister agree that if Rodney Hide does walk, it will actually be a `win-win for his Government?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: That is not the case at all. This Government is providing strong leadership for New Zealand, and all the Ministers, including Mr Hide, are contributing to that.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: Will the Prime Minister be allowing a free vote on Māori seats on the Auckland super-city council by National members of Parliament, as proposed by the Hon Tau Henare in correspondence to the National Party caucus, or is he afraid that the deep divisions seen between ACT and the Māori Party will also be exposed within his own caucus, which has been tolerating Māori issues because of the deal stitched up with the Māori Party?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: The Prime Minister is not afraid of anything—not the least of which is dealing with the party opposite, which itself cannot actually articulate its own position on this issue.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: Does the Prime Minister agree that the idea of having Māori seats on councils is a “foolish preference
 pushed by a few white liberal people on the council who feel guilt”, which is a statement made by the Hon Tony Ryall; if not, has he asked Mr Ryall to keep his controversial views under control in order to preserve the stability and harmony with his Māori Party colleagues?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: The Prime Minister has not asked the Hon Tony Ryall for his view on this issue, because these discussions are ongoing. I assure the member that the Government is working with its support parties every day, providing strong leadership for New Zealand.</p>
      <a name="page_4"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Annette King</strong>: Does the Prime Minister consider the Māori Party to be more expendable when he is considering which side the National Party will take on Māori seats in the Auckland super-city council, because they will not take National Party votes, but the ACT Party stirring up the racial pot will?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: The Prime Minister values the support of both the Māori Party and the ACT Party. He works constructively with them every day of the week. He is able to deal with both of those parties with the respect that they deserve, and maybe that is why that member is sitting over there.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Catherine Delahunty</strong>: Tēnā koe, Mr Speaker. Tēnā koutou. Can the Prime Minister confirm that if Rodney Hide persists with his rabid right-wing agenda, he will be dancing alone with no stars, no Crown cars, and certainly no say over Aucklanders?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: I think it is well known that the ACT Party has strong views on this issue, and we are currently working through the arrangements for the super-city. We are having discussions with support parties and we are not about to start conducting those discussions within the news media.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. This might seem like a fine point, but I think it is an important one. It is my understanding that senior Ministers are outside the country at the moment and that Mr Ryall is Acting Prime Minister.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Darren Hughes</strong>: Bill English is in the country.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I am sorry; if Bill English is here, my point of order—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I am struggling to understand the point of order.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Sorry.</p>
