    <div class="SubsQuestion">
      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>1. KEVIN HAGUE (Green)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister for Biosecurity</strong>: Can he give the public a 100 percent guarantee that imports of palm kernel do not pose biosecurity risks to New Zealand’s farms and environment, particularly in light of the fact that one in 10 shipments have been found to contain insects and animals despite having been fumigated before arriving in New Zealand?</p>
      <a name="page_2"></a>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:04:09"></a>
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE (Leader of the House)</strong> on behalf of the
 <strong>Minister for Biosecurity</strong>: The Minister can no more give a 100 percent guarantee for the importation of palm kernel than he can for the importation of other animal feeds into New Zealand such as soya or tapioca. The Minister is assured through Biosecurity New Zealand that any biosecurity risks associated with the importation of palm kernel are well managed and dealt with appropriately. I think it is worth noting that all of the insects found in palm kernel shipments are deemed most likely to have entered the shipment post its arrival in New Zealand.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Kevin Hague</strong>: Is the Minister aware of reports from dairy farmers of discovering unusual weeds in places where palm kernel has been fed out, and wood, soil, and pieces of metal in imported palm kernel?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: No, I am not aware of that, but I am aware that there are considerable urban myths surrounding the importation of palm kernel. It has been a practice in New Zealand for over a decade. There has even been a suggestion that in one particular shipment, a monkey was found amongst the palm kernels.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Parekura Horomia</strong>: What were you doing there, Gerry?</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: They are simply untrue, and there is a bit of self identification on the other side of the House there. Believe me, if they found Parekura Horomia in there, they would not have thought he was a monkey. This is a serious issue. The New Zealand Government has always taken this seriously, and palm kernel is fumigated prior to departure and quite often during shipment. If there is any suggestion of incursion when it arrives, it is further fumigated.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Kevin Hague</strong>: Is the Minister aware that foot-and-mouth disease is endemic to some of the areas from which palm kernel is imported into New Zealand, that the Canadian authorities have found foot-and-mount disease to be viable in soil for many days, and that the fumigation process to which shipments are exposed has no effect whatsoever on foot-and-mouth disease?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: I do not have that advice, but I am assured that Biosecurity New Zealand does a good job. I say to the member that perhaps he should refer to the
 <em>Hansard</em><strong></strong> of 26 March
 2003, where the Hon Marian Hobbs said to the House “Given that there is the potential of over 100 new pests a day for every day of the year, I think that finding only six in the last fortnight shows that we really are very good at surveillance.” That was in answer to a question about concerns at the time, and the Minister gave a proper answer indicating how seriously New Zealand takes it biosecurity obligations.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Kevin Hague</strong>: Can the Minister confirm that the Government’s assessment of foot-and-mouth disease as being of insignificant risk in palm kernel shipments is based on a 2002 assessment that did not even mention palm kernel and occurred at a time when imports of palm kernel to this country were of a very substantially lower quantity than they are today?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: I am unable to confirm that.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Kevin Hague</strong>: Why does New Zealand continue to import palm kernel when the Minister cannot give a 100 percent guarantee that it will not risk our farming, horticulture, forestry, or even our “100% Pure New Zealand” brand, especially when sufficient supplementary feed is readily available in New Zealand that carries no biosecurity risk at all?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: I again quote from
 <em>Hansard</em><strong></strong>, from 29 March 2006 when the Hon Jim Anderton said, and I think it is right and it serves as a very good answer to this question, “I point
 out to the member that if New Zealand were to try to fund biosecurity systems that would prevent [all possible] incursions into New Zealand, there would not be enough wealth generated in the whole GDP to guarantee that.” New
 Zealand has a very good record for biosecurity, prevention of incursion, and attack upon any organisms that invade our territory where they are a problem. I think we should be recognising Biosecurity New Zealand for the fine work it does.</p>
