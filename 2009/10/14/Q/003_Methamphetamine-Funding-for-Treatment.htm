        <strong>3.
 </strong>
        <strong>Dr PAUL HUTCHISON (National—Hunua)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Health</strong>: Why has the Government approved a plan to invest $22 million over 3 years to help treat methamphetamine users?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:20:26"></a>
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL (Minister of Health)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Methamphetamine is a drug that destroys lives and communities. Every day we read about the pain that this drug causes not only the users but also their families and the innocent victims of their crimes. The Government has announced a comprehensive package of measures to control precursors, break supply chains, and improve access and routes to treatment. The $22 million being invested from the Ministry of Health is to provide better treatment options for users.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Paul Hutchison</strong>: What details can he advise in relation to these better treatment options for users of methamphetamine?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: As many members of the House will know from their constituency work, the families of P users talk about their frustration in trying to find somewhere to get their loved ones treated, and it is very difficult. The resources that the Government is making available under the leadership of the Prime Minister will be used to develop a dedicated treatment pathway for methamphetamine-dependent users, which will include provision for 2,700 users to have ready access to dedicated social detox beds over a 3-year period, and 400 longer-term treatment places will be created for the most seriously affected users over the next 3 years. The Prime Minister has also requested that there be investment in dedicated methamphetamine capacity for the Alcohol Drug Helpline, including new full-time clinical staff.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Jim Anderton</strong>: Can the Minister confirm in terms of priority for the healthcare and well-being of New Zealanders that last year fewer than 10 people died from methamphetamine abuse, 1,000 died from alcohol abuse, and 5,000 people died from smoking?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: I can confirm to the member that the Government is making a significant investment in those areas that he identified but I think it is quite clear that the scourge that methamphetamine represents for our communities and families certainly warrants additional commitment, particularly in the areas of providing a treatment option for those families.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Iain Lees-Galloway</strong>: Why will Kiwis suffering from flu symptoms now have to pay $60 to go to see their doctor and get the medication they need, when the Government has already been offered a free electronic monitoring system that would have exposed the criminals while still maintaining pharmacy supply for bona fide customers?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: Eighty percent of the cold and flu pills purchased in New Zealand today do not contain pseudoephedrine, so most New Zealanders who are using cold and flu tablets are using those without pseudoephedrine; 20 percent are. I am very disappointed that Labour is so opposed to trying to deal with something that represents a huge scourge in so many of our communities, including those represented by the member opposite.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon John Key</strong>: Can the Minister confirm that far from being free, the computer-based model, firstly, does not work, because most pharmacies in New Zealand do not have broadband; secondly, it requires extremely intensive monitoring by police of every transaction; and, thirdly, rather than successful, it as been found to be ineffective in Australia where it is has been trialled?</p>
      <a name="page_4"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: I would be able to confirm that, because the Prime Minister has made it quite clear that that is the case. I can also tell the member that my feedback from around the country is that New Zealanders consider methamphetamine P to be a scourge that warrants a coordinated attack by the Government. If any of those members opposite had ever spoken to parents of kids affected by methamphetamine, they would be changing their mind. When we talk to a grandfather who had to pin his 19-year-old grandson to the ground to stop him from going out and buying his drugs, then we know the heartfelt commitment that New Zealanders feel towards the policy that this Prime Minister has announced.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Paul Hutchison</strong>: How are methamphetamine users treated now, and what will change?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon TONY RYALL</strong>: As any constituency member will tell us, there is a real frustration with families as to their inability to get treatment for their kids who might be P users. It is estimated that of the up to 2,000 people seeking help for methamphetamine addiction each year, only 1,000 of them get the treatment they need. The new dedicated methamphetamine treatment pathway will provide short-term detoxification options whereby users will come off the drug and then be assessed for further treatment, which will include the option of longer-term residential care. Additionally, there will be a greater focus by district health boards on reducing the waiting list for community-based treatment. Treatment is well established in international studies as being cost-effective—in terms of both the personal and the wider social benefits, and the reduction in crime in our communities.</p>
