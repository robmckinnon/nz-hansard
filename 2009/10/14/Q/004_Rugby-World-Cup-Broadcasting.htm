        <strong>4.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon TREVOR MALLARD (Labour—Hutt South)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister for the Rugby World Cup</strong>: What discussions, if any, has he had with Rugby World Cup Ltd on broadcasting rights for the Rugby World Cup 2011, and what consultation has he undertaken on that issue?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:27:08"></a>
        <strong>Hon MURRAY McCULLY (Minister for the Rugby World Cup)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> As the member would know, Rugby World Cup Ltd regards the broadcast rights for the Rugby World Cup as a matter between itself and the broadcasters that have bid for those rights. Accordingly, any discussions regarding broadcasting rights have related to the process and timetable for those rights being resolved. I have had a number of discussions with Ministers and officials, including attending a meeting convened by the Hon Mr English.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Is he responsible for the overall coordination of Government matters to do with the Rugby World Cup; if so, is he proud of his work in relation to this coordination?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon MURRAY McCULLY</strong>: I hold overall responsibility for the coordination of the Rugby World Cup. My position on the broadcasting rights is very simple: I want to see the widest possible access, free to air, for New Zealanders to see the games that they
 are at the present time substantially investing in. To the extent that Māori Television Service will contribute to that process in an economical fashion, I welcome it.</p>
      <a name="page_16"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Why did the Minister confirm to Television New Zealand the financial detail of the Māori Television Service right bid?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon MURRAY McCULLY</strong>: That assertion is simply not accurate.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Is he aware that his behaviour in relation to the chief executive of Te Puni Kōkiri is to be raised with the Prime Minister by the State Services Commission?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon MURRAY McCULLY</strong>: The meeting that I think the member is referring to occurred in the office of the Hon Mr English, and several other Ministers were present. The member himself put out a press release on 2 October in which he raised a number of questions regarding the process for the Māori Television Service bid, and cautioning against a bidding war in which the International Rugby Board would be the only winner. I substantially agree with the questions that the member raised in that press release, and he will find that I put those questions firmly to Mr Comer only a few days prior to the member putting out that press release.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Pete Hodgson</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The member’s question referred to a meeting and the possibility that as a result of that meeting the State Services Commission may be approaching the Prime Minister in respect of the Minister’s behaviour. That aspect of the question was not even remotely addressed.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon MURRAY McCULLY</strong>: I would be very happy to supplement my answer if you wish me to do so, Mr Speaker.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The Minister does not have to do that, because he answered the other part of the question, but if he wishes to help the House, that is to be commended.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon MURRAY McCULLY</strong>: I am not aware of any complaint from Mr Comer in relation to the meeting, but as it was chaired by the Hon Mr English and attended by two other Ministers, I am more than comfortable that they will be able to verify that the questioning of Mr Comer and other officials that I undertook was vigorous and professional.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Does the Minister’s description of the Māori Television Service as “a millstone
 around … the neck of … Government.” justify his approach outside the House, which has been described as involving deceit?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon MURRAY McCULLY</strong>: I suspect that the member is quoting from a very old article that relates to a time when he was a Minister and I was not. My position has been very clear from the beginning: I and the Prime Minister want to see that the New Zealanders who have invested some hundreds of millions of dollars in the Rugby World Cup preparations are able to see the games of the tournament free to air, in the easiest possible fashion, and without significant additional cost. To the extent that the Māori Television Service wants to contribute to that process, I welcome it now, and I always have.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>:
 Tēnā koe, Mr Speaker, kia ora tātau. Ki te Minita mō te Kapu Whutupōro o te Ao, kua mōhio rānei a ia mā te whakapāohotanga o te Taumāhekeheke o te Ao i Peihinga i te tau 2008, me te takariri o te tokomaha ki Te Reo Tātaki o Aotearoa mō te hē o ngā kōrero, mō te koretake o ētahi pātai, mō ngā raruraru hangarau hoki ka mutu, e kore pea ēnei raruraru e aki i a ia ki te tautoko, ko tā Whakaata Māori tono ki te pāho i te Kapu o te Ao hei whai haere i tana mihi nui i tēnei rangi tonu mō ngā mahi papai e hia kē nei a Whakaata Ratonga Māori?</p>
      <ul class="">
        <li>[An interpretation in English was given to the House.]</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="a">[<em>Greetings Mr Speaker and to us. To the Minister for the Rugby World Cup, is he aware that during the coverage of the 2008 Beijing Olympics Television New Zealand
 was accused of having left many viewers fuming because of mucked-up commentary, some dumb questions, and technical glitches; and would that not perhaps influence him to support the Māori Television Service in its bid to screen the Rugby World Cup, particularly acknowledging his statement earlier today that the Māori Television Service has done a good job of much of its sporting coverage?</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <a name="page_17"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon MURRAY McCULLY</strong>: I am reluctant to accept the opportunity to dwell on the shortcomings of other broadcasters in this respect, but I reiterate the response I gave earlier. New Zealand taxpayers have invested some hundreds of millions of dollars in preparations for the Rugby World Cup. Taxpayers deserve, as the Prime Minister has stated in recent days, the opportunity to see the games in that tournament in the easiest possible fashion, and without significant additional cost. To the extent that the Māori Television Service will form part of that process—and that negotiation process is ongoing—I welcome it.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>:
 Ki te Minitā ānō hoki, kei hea ngā pūrongo kua whakatakotoria ki mua i tōna aroaro e kī ana, ko Whakaata Māori anake, te teihana e kore e āhei ki te whakapāoho ki te motu katoa, ā, ka whakaputaina rānei e ia te kōrero pono, arā, kāore e taea e tētahi teihana, te whakapāho ki te motu whānui?</p>
      <ul class="">
        <li>[An interpretation in English was given to the House.]</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="a">[<em>To the Minister again, where are the reports presented to him verifying that the Māori Television Service is the only television broadcaster that does not have universal coverage, or when will he tell the truth and acknowledge that there is no television coverage that gets to all parts of the country?</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am very reluctant to defend Mr McCully against the obvious, but the statement that the Minister does not tell the truth—the fact that he does not tell the truth—cannot be put that way in this House.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I have got myself into trouble here. I just invite the Minister to handle that question in the way he sees fit.</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon MURRAY McCULLY</strong>: I
 again
 reiterate that New Zealand taxpayers have invested some hundreds of millions of dollars in preparations for the Rugby World Cup 2011. The Government believes that they deserve the opportunity to have access to those games without significant additional cost. To the extent that the Māori Television Service can contribute to that process, I welcome it. I do not intend to enter the debate that others can have about what coverage can be provided by what channel. The International Rugby Board has a process, which is ongoing, for the resolution of the various bids that are on the table. I am comfortable with leaving that matter in its hands, and with the issues amongst the various broadcasters to be dealt with through a different process.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Te Ururoa Flavell</strong>: He take whakatau e Te Mana Whakawā.
 Kia ora, Mr Speaker. Ki taku mōhio, kāore tērā whakautu i whakautu i taku pātai ka mutu, āe, he pai tonu te kōrero engari, ko taku pātai hei whaiwhai haere ko tāna i whakatakoto mai ai, he ngoikore te pāoho a Whakaata Māori ki ērā atu teihana. Ko tāku īnoi ki a koe, māna tēnei e whakautua.</p>
      <ul class="">
        <li>[An interpretation in English was given to the House.]</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="a">[<em>I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Thank you, Mr Speaker. To my knowledge, that response did not answer my question; further to that, yes, his grandstanding was eloquent, but my question for him to follow up related to the statement he made that coverage by Māori Televison, compared with that of other broadcasters, was weaker. My plea to you is that he should be made to answer it.</em><strong></strong>]
 </p>
      <a name="page_18"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I believe, in fairness, that the question was a bit marginal, in any case, and I think it would be unreasonable for me to try to force the Minister to give a different kind of answer.</p>
