      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>11.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon PETE HODGSON (Labour—Dunedin North)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Broadcasting</strong>: Is he satisfied with the quality of the investigation by NZ On Air into the TV series <em>Asia Down Under</em><strong></strong> as reported on 21 May 2009; if so, why?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_15:46:07"></a>
        <strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN (Minister of Broadcasting)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Yes; because I have confidence in the chair and chief executive officer of NZ On Air.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Pete Hodgson</strong>: How then does the Minister explain why the 21 May “not guilty” findings of the first inquiry were broadcast far and wide, but the findings of the 12 June inquiry showing a $100,000 rort were conveyed in only one letter, addressed personally to Melissa Lee?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN</strong>: I think the member would have to ask NZ On Air about that. I make the point that a $100,000 rort was not mentioned in that letter, and I think the member is misleading the House on that point.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Pete Hodgson</strong>: Approximately how many times did the Minister meet NZ On Air in June, July, and August of this year?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN</strong>: That is a very silly question to put forward as an oral question. If the member wants to put it forward as a written question, I will quite happily give him the answer to it, because I can look in my diary and tell him.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Pete Hodgson</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. It seems to me that if it was a silly question you would not have allowed it. I remind you that I started my question by saying: “Approximately how many times …”. I was asking for a rough guess. That is not a silly question. It suggests that the Minister may want to give us an estimate.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN</strong>: I might just as well answer a question on the length of a piece of string—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I accept that the question is not absolutely specifically targeted at the primary question. However, it is related. I think it is not acceptable for the Minister to say that a question is a silly question. If the Minister does not have the information with him, then that is a perfectly acceptable answer. The member said “approximately”. It is not really acceptable to tell a member that a question is a silly question. I would like the Minister, please, to treat the House with a little more respect than that.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN</strong>: I cannot tell the member offhand, but I am quite happy to supply the answer as a written answer.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Pete Hodgson</strong>: Does the Minister meet with NZ On Air monthly, or is it more or less frequently than that?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN</strong>: Less.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Pete Hodgson</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I think my point is a little obvious. If the answer to the question is “yes”, and the question was—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Members</strong>: Less!</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: There will not be interjections. I heard the answer as: “Less.” The member asked whether the Minister met more or less frequently than once a month, and the Minister’s answer that I heard was: “Less.”</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Pete Hodgson</strong>: Does the Minister believe the comment of his colleague Melissa Lee that she first found out about the misappropriation yesterday—12 October—when the letter from NZ On Air—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>:
 Order! I am on my feet.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Melissa Lee</strong>: Idiot!</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: That is totally unacceptable. I ask whoever made that interjection to stand, withdraw, and apologise for it, because the Speaker was on his feet and had
 called the questioner to order. I call Melissa Lee. I want to hear the withdrawal and apology.</p>
      <a name="page_6917"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Melissa Lee</strong>: I withdraw and apologise.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I thank the member. Now let me deal with this matter. I think the member asking the question needs to accept that the Minister is in no way responsible for any actions Melissa Lee may have taken. I invite him, since this is his last supplementary question, to reword that question to bring it within Standing Orders.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Pete Hodgson</strong>: Has the Minister received any advice from his officials as to why Melissa Lee said that her misappropriation was discovered by her only yesterday—12 October—when those same officials sent a letter personally addressed to her, dated 12 June?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN</strong>: I am sorry; can the member just restate the question?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>:
 I invite
 the member to repeat the question.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Pete Hodgson</strong>: Has the Minister received any advice from his officials as to why his colleague Melissa Lee said that she first found out about the misappropriation yesterday on 12 October, when his officials signed off a letter to her dated 12 June telling her all about it?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr JONATHAN COLEMAN</strong>: No.</p>
