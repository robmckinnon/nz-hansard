            <strong>Hon JOHN KEY (Prime Minister)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I seek leave to move a motion without notice relating to the recent tsunami in the Pacific.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Is there any objection to that course being followed? There is no objection.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I move,
 <em>That this Parliament express its sympathy and concern to the people of Samoa, American Samoa and Tonga following the recent Pacific tsunami, and that it extend its condolences to New Zealanders who lost family members and friends in that tragedy</em><strong></strong>.</p>
          <p class="a">On Tuesday, 29 September after a magnitude 8.3 earthquake the sea rose up and struck several islands in Samoa, American Samoa, and Tonga with overwhelming force. It destroyed villages, devastated communities, and tore families apart. It took the lives of approximately 190 people, and changed for ever the lives of thousands more. Nine New Zealanders were killed and one is missing. On behalf of this House and all New Zealanders, I express our deepest sorrow and condolences to those who lost loved ones in this tragedy. Our hearts go out to them. Our thoughts will be with them in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
          <p class="a">In Samoa, an estimated 4,500 people had their homes destroyed or damaged. Three primary schools and one secondary school were ruined. When I visited the weekend before last with Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, I returned to some of the places that had welcomed us so warmly in July. They were almost unrecognisable. In Poutasi village, which has strong links to New Zealand, at least seven people were lost to the waves, and every building that was not concrete was destroyed. The communities devastated by the waves have a lot of work ahead of them, and I am pleased that New Zealand is helping them to recover. It has been humbling to see the huge public support for tsunami relief efforts. I thank the charitable groups and aid organisations that have leaped into action, and the thousands of New Zealanders who have generously donated. I also thank Air New Zealand for its support of aid efforts since the tsunami.</p>
          <p class="a">New Zealand is providing a lot of help on the ground. I thank our consular staff, who juggled the difficult tasks of coordinating relief assistance while accounting for our citizens caught up in the disaster. We have deployed to Samoa over 100 Defence Force personnel, including medics, environmental health officers, engineers, air crews, and navy divers; about 20 police officers; search and recovery teams; victim identification teams; about 30 doctors and nurses, who are helping to treat casualties and maintain public health; and staff from NZAID and several non-governmental organisations. I
 thank each and every one of them for their good work. They have had a very difficult and often harrowing time. Some that I spoke to had been working for up to 20 hours straight per day, yet they were in good spirits. We are all very proud of them and the help that they are providing to these communities on behalf of the people of New Zealand.</p>
          <a name="page_6908"></a>
          <p class="a">New Zealand has also committed military assets. An Orion was stationed in Samoa for the initial search and rescue. A Hercules and Boeing 757-200 have airlifted supplies and personnel. Two Iroquois helicopters were stationed on Upolu. The HMNZS
 <em>Canterbury</em><strong></strong> sailed from Auckland on Saturday loaded with aid and donated goods. She berthed this morning in Nuku’alofa and is expected to arrive in Apia on Thursday.</p>
          <p class="a">New Zealand has been helping in other ways. We are working with several nations to coordinate the international response. We provided $2 million of initial emergency funding to help the Samoan and Tongan Governments, Red Cross, and other non-governmental organisations to deliver aid. On Sunday we announced that the Government will donate a further $6 million. This was matched with a similar donation by Australia. We are committed to helping the people of Samoa and Tonga and their economies recover over the long term.</p>
          <p class="a">On behalf of this House, I acknowledge other disasters that have occurred in the Pacific region recently. We send condolences to the people of Indonesia and their relatives in New Zealand following the earthquake on 30 September. We send our condolences to the people of the Philippines, Vietnam, and Cambodia who are recovering from Typhoon Ketsana. New Zealand has provided $1 million in aid to these countries. We have also sent a team of earthquake engineers to Indonesia. I thank the engineers who have volunteered and the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering for their contributions.</p>
          <p class="a">Last week’s Pacific tsunami was a tragedy for the many people affected, but from the very worst of events we often see the very best of the human spirit. We saw that spirit in the stories of great bravery that have been told over the past few weeks, where people risked everything to warn others and save many lives. We have seen that spirit in the outpouring of support from New Zealanders to their Pacific friends, and we saw that spirit in recent memorial services, as people gathered in love, in faith, and in hope to help each other find peace and comfort in the midst of grief and loss. It is my hope, and the goal of this Government, that we will see the same spirit in the months and years ahead as New Zealand works with the people of Samoa and Tonga to help them bind up their communities, rebuild their lives, and rebuild their livelihoods. We look forward to working with the members of this House towards that end. May all those who lost their lives rest in peace.</p>

            <strong>Hon ANNETTE KING (Deputy Leader—Labour)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Today, along with the Government and all New Zealanders, the Labour Opposition wants to pass on our heartfelt sympathy and love to the people of Samoa, Tonga, and American Samoa. Many New Zealanders became aware of the unfolding tragedy on 30 September after the tsunami had struck. We watched in horror as the first pictures of the death and devastation that had been caused reached us. Where once there were thriving tourist resorts, now there was debris, where once there were villages teeming with life and the sound of children, there was silence, and where once there were gardens and trees, there was nothing. The magnitude of the disaster became apparent to us all as the days passed. Then the memories of 2004 came back, but this time the disaster was closer to home. It was in our neighbourhood, causing massive grief and despair.</p>
          <p class="a">I saw a headline in a newspaper that read “Samoans and Kiwis now as one”. That is how many of us felt; so many of us know people in Samoa and Tonga. We have travelled there, we have made friends there, and we have family there. New Zealand
 has, for a long time, had a strong relationship with Samoa, Tonga, and American Samoa, and the deaths of around 190 people have touched the lives of many people in all countries. But we are more than close neighbours. Thousands of Samoans and Tongans call New Zealand home. We are linked culturally, by marriage, by birth, and by history, and that is why we all stand as one to help our Pacific friends. We share their grief. Because natural disasters do not discriminate and Kiwis along with Samoans and Tongans have perished, we share their grief.</p>
          <a name="page_6909"></a>
          <p class="a">We also share their strength, because despite the massive pain that the tsunami has caused, everybody has been touched by the stories of personal courage and determination. Who will forget the family who lost 13 family members but had the strength to carry on supporting each other and helping those around them? No one will forget the story of the mum who lost three of her babies, having been unable to do anything to save them, but who is determined to rebuild her life. There are numerous stories of courage and strength, and they continue to emerge. I think the telling of those stories will strengthen us all.</p>
          <p class="a">The Opposition fully supports the New Zealand Government in giving whatever assistance may be necessary to rebuild people’s lives and their homes. I have read and heard of many examples of people who are digging deep to help to rebuild Tonga and Samoa, from children raising money at roadside stalls right through to big corporations donating money for infrastructure. I do not think we can rest until our close neighbours, friends, and families restore their homes, their livelihood, and their future. As an old Samoan saying goes: “Let us remain true in our faith. Let us be strong, be patient, be courageous. As the sun sets, the sun will rise again.”</p>
          <p class="a">Our deepest sympathy and condolences go out not only to the people of Samoa and Tonga but also to the people here in New Zealand whose loved ones lost their lives.</p>

            <strong>Dr RUSSEL NORMAN (Co-Leader—Green)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Today the Green Party honours victims of the tsunami in the independent State of Samoa, American Samoa, and Tonga. We pay tribute to those who have worked tirelessly to help the survivors and rebuild shattered communities. The tragic events show just how vulnerable our Pacific Island neighbours are to natural disasters such as the devastating tsunami. Small island States are at the forefront of extreme weather events but are often the least equipped to cope. The people of Samoa have responded admirably to the challenge of rebuilding their lives and their nation. The response to the disaster here in New Zealand has been gratifying, and I acknowledge those who have contributed to the relief effort, donated goods, and organised and attended fund-raising events.</p>
          <p class="a">This crisis powerfully reminds us that Aotearoa New Zealand is a Pacific nation. We stand beside our Island brothers and sisters in solidarity. We share their tears and their pain. We share their optimism for the future and their desire to rebuild. The bond between New Zealand and Samoa is strong. The Samoan community in New Zealand has helped to redefine our national identity. Samoan New Zealanders contribute strongly to this nation’s cultural, artistic, sporting, and spiritual life. Today we acknowledge that deep and enduring relationship and send our alofa to Samoa.</p>

            <strong>DAVID GARRETT (ACT)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I rise on behalf of the ACT Party to express our utmost sympathy for the victims of this tragic event affecting our Pacific brothers and sisters. It goes without saying that our hearts go out to all of those who have been affected, in whichever country. Much of the world’s attention, and certainly ours, is quite rightly centred on Samoa, and for good reason: Samoa bore the brunt of the damage inflicted by the tsunami, both in terms of lives lost and in devastation. But Tonga has also been affected. It is the second human tragedy to befall the kingdom in the last 3 months, following the loss of the
 <em>Princess Ashika</em><strong></strong>, in which 74 people died, their bodies never to
 be recovered. The loss in Samoa and American Samoa is awful, but let us not forget that the loss in Tonga is no less great for the families of the victims.</p>
          <a name="page_6910"></a>
          <p class="a">The event is a reminder of how all our Pacific neighbours and ourselves are vulnerable to these events. Had this tsunami occurred 500 kilometres to the east, it would have devastated Fiji in very similar ways to what occurred in Samoa. Had it been 500 kilometres to the south, the Tongan main island of Tongatapu, where I lived for a number of years, would have been entirely obliterated, as it is a low atoll.</p>
          <p class="a">The latest reports suggest that the death toll across the region will be higher than the 190 currently recorded in the media. This will come as no surprise to those of us who are familiar with the Pacific. Some of the areas hit are incredibly remote. Niuatoputapu, together with Nuiafo‘ou, the northern extremity of the Tongan islands, are 500 kilometres from mainland Tonga and are, in fact, closer to Samoa than Tonga. Scattered reports from there suggest that over 60 percent of the buildings in Niuatoputapu were destroyed by a 6-metre wall of water—utter devastation. It is an island the size of, or a little larger than, Rangitoto and is home to 1,400 people, 10 of whom were taken. There was massive damage to an already limited infrastructure. People there have lived at one with the sea for generations, and they will not soon forget this tragedy. Any rumbling of the earth will cause the locals to flee to higher ground, where it exists, to seek refuge in the case of another disaster.</p>
          <p class="a">Yet, by contrast, the response by Kiwis was typically cynical, and some would say foolish. New Zealanders flocked in their droves to the beaches. Many took an hour off work, even here in Parliament, to wander down to Oriental Bay. Parents took their children. One can only gape in wonder at what they were thinking, and at the danger they were putting themselves and their loved ones in. New Zealanders need to wake up to the very real danger of tsunami in our part of the world. We are a coastal nation, with most of our cities lying on the coast or near water. A similar event off the coast of this country would flatten many towns and cities, wreaking utter havoc. I would like to pay tribute to a young girl, who I believe is from the Wellington area, who had made a study of the phenomenon of tsunamis. She realised very quickly what was happening in Samoa and was able to warn people, saving who knows how many lives.</p>
          <p class="a">Although we mourn the loss of our cousins and friends in Samoa and Tonga, let us not forget that one day we may find ourselves in a similar situation to theirs. Let us learn from this tragedy while we help our neighbours to rebuild. To our friends in Samoa and Tonga, ofa atu, alofa tele atu.</p>

          <p class="Speech">
            <a name="time_14:18:46"></a>Hon<strong> Dr PITA SHARPLES (Co-Leader—Māori Party)</strong><strong>:</strong> Tēnā koe, Mr Speaker. Tēnā tātou katoa e te Whare nei.</p>
          <p class="a">Matou te manatua pea aiga Pasefika o
 lo’omafatiai nei taimi faigata. Ua tiga faatasi o matou loto mo outou. O
 lo’omaligi pea o matou loimata, ona o le
 fa’aleagaina o
 outou eleele ma e umi se taimi o matou lagona
 fa’atasi le
 tiga ma outou. We think of our Pacific families at this traumatic time. Our hearts have bled with theirs. Our tears flow at the loss of lives, at the damage to their lands, and at the sadness that will last for months and years ahead.</p>
          <p class="a">When the news broke just under a fortnight ago that an 8.3 magnitude earthquake had struck, and the subsequent tsunami was observed, it took some time to sink in. As cabled photographs were relayed over wire and we saw the ferocious 6-metre waves crashing down, the full extent of the disaster became known. Today we join with others in the House to bow our heads in the profound grief we all feel as we pay our respects to the 184 people who lost their lives that day in Samoa, American Samoa, and Tonga.</p>
          <p class="a">In split seconds, 20 villages were completely destroyed, families were torn apart, and loved ones were ripped from each other. Even now several hundred people are still nursing injuries. Over 15,000 people have been directly affected by this tragic twist of
 fate, but it is the long-term trauma that is now starting to take hold. These are people who for centuries have lived on the coastline, but now they are suddenly homeless and dealing with the devastating wreckage left behind. Some have fled to the bush and have still not come out. I remember with love Tui Annandale, a dear friend, the wife of Joe, who was lost from the village of Poutasi.</p>
          <a name="page_6911"></a>
          <p class="a">Others have focused on the funerals that are still occurring, but they have no idea about what to do next. One family in Lalomanu buried nine members from four different generations, from ages 2 to 97. The human cost of that will never be able to be measured. For many it will be a long, painful journey to rebuild lives and to restore Samoa to the island paradise they know it to be. The Māori Party extends our deepest sympathies to all of those families, who will keep replaying in their minds the fate they suffered that day.</p>
          <p class="a">Last Sunday was White Sunday, the time when children are celebrated, when the possibilities of the next generation give reason for great joy. But this year’s ceremonies were marred by the grief of the 9,000 children affected by the tsunami, at least 2,000 of whom are thought to be displaced.</p>
          <p class="a">But perhaps the most incredible thing of all is that in the midst of such devastation, hope is still able to be found. We in the Māori Party place on record our utter admiration for all those courageous souls who have the strength of character to remake their world around them. This last fortnight has shown some amazing examples of the human spirit at its best. Who could forget the young boy searching for his relatives, motivated by his commitment to ensure that each one was buried in dignity; the families uprooting themselves to help those who need it most; or the communities fighting through the chaos of rubble to reconstruct sanitation facilities and to provide access to clean water, shelter, and protection from the elements?</p>
          <p class="a">We want also to acknowledge the fierce sense of pride that all New Zealanders must have in the way in which this nation has responded. We acknowledge the effort of a gutsy Wellington 10-year-old, Abby Wutzler, who ran the length of the beach at Lalomanu, warning holidaymakers to head for the hills away from the tsunami. Disaster victim identification specialists, New Zealand police, Royal New Zealand Air Force personnel, grief counsellors, infectious disease specialists, doctors, nurses—a literal army of support—have dropped everything to help. Theatre nurse Debbie Ratima summed it up: “These people need our help and so that’s something you prepare yourself for and get stuck in and help.” A group of Samoan community leaders in Auckland has also got stuck in to help, including former All Black La’auli Michael Jones, Judge Ida Malosi, David Tua, Va’aiga Tuigamala, and others. Indeed, the reaction of the Samoan and Tongan communities in Aotearoa has been legendary in their immediate expression of whakawhanaungatanga, of caring for their loved ones back on the islands.</p>
          <p class="a">It is times like this when we truly feel part of the Pacific village, and we must do all we can to care for our neighbours. We must rebuild homes and infrastructure, and the $6 million given to help recovery efforts is a vital part of that. But equally important are the 10 containers of donated goods from the Samoan and Tongan communities in Auckland, the 15 pallets of supplies for Tonga, and the supplies and equipment that all our donations can help to provide.</p>
          <p class="a">Finally, as tangata whenua we express our deepest sadness for our Pasifika cousins, to whom we are bound by the Pacific Ocean, by common whakapapa, and by a powerful sense of connection. Our prayers and our love go to the people of Samoa and of Tonga. O le a matou tatalo ma alolofa atu mo outou uma i Samoa ma Toga.
 Fa’amalolosi pea ma loto toa, ma ia outou mautinoa o
 lo’omatoumanatua pea outou. Thank you.</p>

            <strong>Hon JIM ANDERTON (Leader—Progressive)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> None of us know for certain how we would react under extreme circumstances but most of us would like to hope that we would be capable, in the terrifying reality and aftermath of a tsunami like this, of behaving with the same courage, dignity, generosity, and determination as our Samoan cousins have shown to the world. To put this disaster in context, on a population basis 3,330 New Zealanders would have died under similar circumstances. The Samoan tsunami deaths represent over 13 times the number of people killed in the Mount Erebus crash, 22 times the number who died in the Tangiwai rail disaster, 238 times the number who died at Cave Creek, and 62 times the number who drowned in the
 <em>Wahine</em><strong></strong> disaster. In the United States of America this tragedy would have registered 231,397 deaths, compared with the 3,025 who died in the twin towers disaster. It sometimes requires us, I think, for small countries like Samoa, to register those kinds of comparisons in order to realise the impact this tragedy will have on that small nation.</p>
          <p class="a">That New Zealand hearts have gone out to our Samoan neighbours at this time of crisis is clear to everyone. That people with skills who can help, or with money to contribute for immediate aid as well as reconstruction, have all been doing so generously is as it should be. One always knows who one’s friends are at a time of great need, and at no time in my lifetime have New Zealanders and Samoans felt closer than they do today.</p>

            <strong>Hon PETER DUNNE (Leader—United Future)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> From time to time in this House we pass a resolution to pay tribute to someone who has passed on, to lament some tragic event, or to note some extraordinary achievement. But it is a very rare occasion to pass a resolution that deals with an issue so tragic and so close to home. In the aftermath of the tsunami that struck Samoa, American Samoa, and Tonga on 30 September, many of us checked with our friends and colleagues who come from those countries whether their families had been affected, how they were feeling, and what the impact on them was. It had a very immediate and powerful influence on all of us, and our hearts go out to all those who have suffered loss, to all those who are now looking in the middle of the debris and wondering how on earth they can put life back together again.</p>
          <p class="a">When the first reports started to come through that there had been a powerful earthquake in the Pacific and that the emergency centre in Hawaii was predicting some form of tsunami, I do not think any of us could have imagined what was about to unfold. The messages were confused and chaotic, which raises some issues that I know the Minister of Civil Defence has under review, but as the day went on and the scope of the tragedy unfolded, and we started to realise what devastation had been wreaked upon those islands, we too started to realise our vulnerability—not just as a nation and not just as a people, but our individual vulnerability in such circumstances.</p>
          <p class="a">I suppose it is natural—and it is a good thing about this country—that New Zealand has responded the way it has: the emergency programmes that the Prime Minister referred to in his address, the individual acts of generosity, and the kindnesses and support that have been shown by so many to those who have been affected. We do it because it is instinctive. We do it because although we do not understand precisely the scale of the tragedy, we know it is beyond immediate comprehension. We know that it will not simply be put right tomorrow. It will take many, many years of effort and hardship to overcome that tragedy, and all the while the threat is there of another one tomorrow.</p>
          <p class="a">An occasion like this is an opportunity for this Parliament to express its support for those who are suffering, its confidence in those who are working to provide for their relief, and its unity in terms of generally reflecting the overall human condition at a time like this. This is a time of great sadness, and it is a time of great learning, not just for the people who have been affected but also for countries like ours, which have their own
 vulnerabilities. But even with the best preparation in the world, there comes a time when forces far greater will have their say, and that will be the real test of the human spirit. I believe that in this country and in Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, and the other parts of the Pacific that have been affected by similar tragedies in recent times the human spirit has shone through strongly. Long may it continue to do so, because that is our ultimate strength and our ultimate capacity to survive.</p>

            <strong>Hon LUAMANUVAO WINNIE LABAN (Labour—Mana)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Avea i lenei avanoa le mamalu tele o le Palemene, ae maife le fa’afofoga a le atunu’u o Niu Sila, Samoa ma Tonga, o le Alefa ma le Omeka, o le Amataga ma le Gata’aga, o mea uma i lenei olaga e o’o lava i le soifua o le tagata. I greet members in the sacredness of the House of Parliament and our connection as peoples of the Pacific, New Zealand, Samoa, and Tonga. Talofa lava, malo lelei, and warm Pacific greetings.</p>
          <p class="a">Early on 29 September, Samoan time, I heard the news of the earthquake and tsunami hitting Samoa. As more information came in about the impact of this disaster, I knew that I must go to Samoa. Phil Goff and Annette King, the leader and deputy leader of the Labour Party, encouraged Chris Carter and I to go to Samoa. We did not want to make any fuss or have any media interviews. We just went as soon as we could. I took the first flight I could get to Samoa, and at 2.20 p.m. on that day I was on the plane to Samoa.</p>
          <p class="a">During the next 2 days we visited villages on the southern coast of Opolu—Lalomanu, Aleipata, Poutasi, Lepa, Falealili, and much of the area the tsunami devastated. We also spent time at the Moto’otua Hospital. We met with the Prime Minister, Tuila’epa Sailele Malielegaoi, and other Samoan Government officials. The Prime Minister asked us to attend a meeting of the Samoan National Disaster Coordination and Distribution Committee, and I also spent time with the Hon Fiame Naomi Mata’afa, who is Minister responsible for village councils.</p>
          <p class="a">We all talked about how best to help. I went to offer my alofa, support, and encouragement. In difficult times we must be with our people. Members have all seen the photographs in the newspapers and on the television, have heard the voices on the radio, and will all know what things look like in Samoa. Seeing what has happened on the ground was deeply disturbing. Fales were wrecked, churches demolished, villages in ruin, bodies on the beach, and people were scared, traumatised, and in shock.</p>
          <p class="a">What the news coverage does not show is the spirit and faith of our people, the alofa, the fa’aaloalo, and agaga—the love, the reciprocity, and spirituality, and our deep belief in God’s love and strength. I was so proud to see the way that Samoans who were suffering were looking after the New Zealanders, Australians, and others who had suffered alongside them, and in turn, New Zealanders and Australians were supporting Samoans. It was great to see that the Kiwi spirit is strong, and everybody was working well together. I was proud to be a Samoan and a New Zealander. I was encouraged by the way that we became one people, one family, in these difficult days.</p>
          <p class="a">On Thursday morning we attended the funeral service of my cousin Joe Annandale’s wife, Tui. It was the first of many. Then my cousin Imo took us in a taxi to visit the hospital and all the villages on the southern coast. In the hospital many people were being treated for their injuries and recovering from the physical and emotional trauma. I met a Samoan woman who had lost two of her grandchildren, and New Zealanders who had lost children and other family members. One Kiwi couple had lost their child of 2½ years. In the villages we met Samoans who had lost 10 or more family members. We also met the Taufua family. In Poutasi one of the wives of the pastors had passed on.</p>
          <p class="a">The loss is great. So many people have lost everything. The people whom I talked to asked for support to come direct: family to family, village to village, and church to church. In time, the villages will be rebuilt. The scars on the landscape will soon be
 smoothed away, the trees and the plants will grow again, and schools, churches, and businesses will be re-established. But it will take much longer to heal the loss of family and friends. Those whom we have lost will be with us for ever. “Inside us our dead, our dead are the proud robes our souls wear. We are the remembered cord that stretches across the abyss of all that we have forgotten. We don’t inherit the past, but a creation of our remembering.”</p>
          <a name="page_6914"></a>
          <p class="a">Let us remember those we have lost in the disaster. Let us stand with our people during this time of suffering, and give them support, hope, and encouragement. Let us work together to support the peoples of Samoa, Niuatoputapu, and Tonga with their rebuilding. In English, I say: “The heart of the earth weeps with sadness, but God’s strength will grant us healing and peace.” Tatou te momoe ma manu ae lilo mala e ati a’e. E tagi le fatu ma le ’ele ’ele o le puapuaga, ae to’a i le Atua lona filemu.</p>

            <strong>PESETA SAM LOTU-IIGA (National—Maungakiekie)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Ou te
 fa’atalofa atu
 i le
 päia ma le mamalu o le aofia. Mr Speaker, I greet you, members of this House, and those listening and watching across this nation. I stand to also offer my condolences to the friends and family of those who were taken by the tsunami that hit the Pacific on 29 September. Almost 200 lives have been taken—every life precious, every person loved. Every individual will be missed by friends and family, both in the Pacific and across this nation.</p>
          <p class="a">Returning to the place of my birth with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I witnessed firsthand the destructive force of nature on the people of Samoa. Fales were flattened, schools were decimated, businesses were ruined, and churches were crushed. The scene of some of my most fond childhood memories was destroyed by the cruel power of the sea. Although there was much pain and suffering, we saw firsthand the resolve of the Samoan people. They were busy clearing debris and restoring water supplies and electricity lines, and somehow they were looking forward to a brighter future. As my colleague and cousin Luamanuvao has pointed out, they spoke a lot about their faith that their relatives were now at peace and in a better place.</p>
          <p class="a">Some of the worst atrocities bring out the best in people. The response of the New Zealand Government, the non-governmental organisation sector, and the general public of New Zealand and around the world has been swift, effective, and overwhelming. I have seen firsthand the tsunami relief efforts in Auckland linking community organisers and faith leaders, along with Government representatives. It is good that we can put our biases and partisanship aside to work towards a common goal. It has brought a community together to organise container-loads of goods, supplies, and materials, and to organise fund-raising concerts and sports matches, as well as memorial services. The resources that come from the fund-raising effort will be critical in the rebuilding of the villages and families that have been most affected by this catastrophe.</p>
          <p class="a">Adversity has brought unity. Suffering has brought resolve. And loss has brought about a new sense of purpose, urgency, and hope. This tragedy has also shown the great love that the people of Aotearoa New Zealand have for our Pacific neighbours. Pākehā, Māori, Asian, European—New Zealanders of all backgrounds have given of their time and resources to help those in need. My plea in this House is that the people of New Zealand continue to support the relief efforts in Samoa, Tonga, and American Samoa. Although the financial support and donations of food, clothing, and supplies are welcome, in the long term the recovery of those islands will require a greater level of support, comfort, and, above all, aroha.</p>
          <p class="a">Finally, to our families and friends in the Pacific, I say that we feel your pain, we grieve for your loved ones, and we honour their lives. Keep faithful, be strong, and know that our prayers and thoughts are with you always. Ofa atu. Soifua ma ia manuia.</p>

          <p class="a">I have used the language of my elders to convey my gratitude, first and foremost, to this House for the privilege of being able to share and support the Government’s motion. I have conveyed in appropriate Samoan language the depth of emotion that I share with members of the New Zealand House of Representatives over the loss of so many lives as a result of the tidal wave scattering its mighty anger on the islands of Samoa, Niuatoputapu, and Tutuila. I acknowledge that clouds hover over those islands of the Pacific, and I recognise, in particular, the depth of sadness that the leaders of those countries experience. I acknowledge the pain and grief that so many, including members of this House, must feel at the personal loss of families.</p>
          <p class="a">The last few weeks have been an overwhelming experience of pain, anguish, sorrow, and love. We have all shed tears. We have all felt the pain and sorrow. It did not matter that we may not be related. The people of Aotearoa New Zealand shared in the loss of others, our neighbours, our friends, our aiga, our family. It has been immensely difficult for the many, both in Samoa and New Zealand, who lost family members.</p>
          <p class="a">Many have lost, and I wish to add my condolences for all who have lost their lives in the tsunami. By way of paying tribute to all, I pay tribute to one who died in the line of duty in Samoa on Tuesday, 29 September. Peter Letiu was one of the first to die, after an accident, as he and his team of firemen rushed to the Aleipata district to provide assistance. His was one of the first bodies found in the aftermath of the tsunami in Samoa. His, in fact, was the third recorded death. He was a member of Samoa’s fire brigade. On the morning of Tuesday, 29 September Peter and four others were in a fire truck heading towards the low-lying villages of Aleipata to alert them of the tsunami. Unfortunately, the fire truck tipped over a steep cliff, injuring all of them. They were reportedly all injured, but they were all alive at that point. Local Samoan media reported that two young local Samoan boys from a nearby village watched over the overturned firefighter truck and its injured passengers. Peter’s boss—Samoa’s fire commissioner, Seve Tony Hill—said at his funeral yesterday that Peter died in hospital of his injuries. He was the first firefighter to die in the line of duty in Samoa. As Peter’s coffin was lowered into its final resting place his boss stood guard and saluted his final passage home.</p>
          <p class="a">Peter’s family and friends in Auckland, of all nationalities, mourn his passing. He was well known to Pacific circles in Auckland, in media, and in advertising. Peter went to live in Samoa last year to help his mother, from the village of Sataoa. His father, wife, daughter, and siblings live in Māngere. His body was brought back to Māngere late last week, and on Sunday night friends and family began to gather for his family service, and then yesterday for his burial. He will be remembered as a hero who died trying to save his people. Peter leaves a proud legacy for his daughter to follow in. He leaves behind a strong but grieving wife, who is leaning heavily on her faith to see her through the years ahead. We as Samoans are proud of his heroism, his courage under fire, and his putting the lives of others ahead of his own. His dad got up to give a testimony but could not find the words. To sum up the feeling that was felt by his dad, he later said: “Ua oge manatu; ua sola mafaufauga.” That is to say: “My mind is blank; my thoughts have gone from me.” He said he loved his son.</p>
          <a name="page_6916"></a>
          <p class="a">In conclusion, I express, and pass on to this House, the sincere gratitude of the Samoan and Tongan communities to all of New Zealand for the overwhelming support that has come forward. Everyone needs to be thanked—donors, businesses, schools, organisations, individuals, and families—for the support that has come forward and that has lightened the burdens of many of us who have lost loved ones. So to all of New Zealand I say fa‘afetai, fa‘afetai, fa‘afetai tele lava. May God bless the Pacific and may the dark clouds that cover these nations—Samoa, Niuatoputapu, and Tutuila—quickly dissipate. Ia soifua.</p>
