      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>4.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon DAVID CUNLIFFE (Labour—New Lynn)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Finance</strong>: Does he stand by all his recent statements?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:30:37"></a>
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE (Minister for Economic Development)</strong> on behalf of the
 <strong>Minister of Finance</strong>: Yes.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon David Cunliffe</strong>: Did he use his influence as shareholding Minister to promote himself and the views of the National Government in an advertisement that ran during prime time on Television New Zealand (TVNZ)?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: No. TVNZ invited
 him to appear, and the programme that it is trying to promote, <em>Plain English,
 </em><strong></strong>clearly plays on his name<em>.</em><strong></strong> He assumes that the company invited him to be on the programme and to front it because he is considered to be almost as economically literate as the Prime Minister, and, most likely, almost as good looking as him, as well. He is sure that if the—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I have called the Hon David Cunliffe. I think we have heard sufficient.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon David Cunliffe</strong>: Can he confirm whether TVNZ approached him or his office regarding this self-promotion
 on<em>Plain English</em><strong></strong>, or did he or his office approach TVNZ?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: I suggest that the question is inappropriately asked, because it talks about who approached whom over self-promotion. I made it very clear in the first answer that TVNZ had invited the Minister to appear. It is
 their
 initiative, it is their programme, and it is their format. The Minister has simply said that, yes, he will participate. I am sure that if the Labour Party had had something important to say, it would have been equally welcome to participate.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon David Cunliffe</strong>: Has the Minister or his staff had any input into the preparation, scripting, or editing of this promotion, at any time?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: As I said before, it is a TVNZ initiative. Their invitation was issued to the office of the Minister of Finance, and—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon David Cunliffe</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The question was a different question from the previous supplementary question. The previous supplementary question, to be fair to the Minister, asked who had approached whom, and the Minister answered that question. The second supplementary question asked whether the Minister or his staff had had any input into, or involvement in the
 preparation of—any involvement of any kind—the production of that promotion. It is not—</p>
      <a name="page_5"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I think the member has made his point. I ask the Minister to come to the answer.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: Of course his office has not been involved in matters relating to the production of the programme, nor has his office been involved in promoting the programme. But his office most certainly has been concerned to ensure the accuracy of the script. Of course, I am sure that one or two of his advisers advised him on how he should appear on the programme. None of that would be unusual.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon David Cunliffe</strong>: In taking advice from TVNZ as to the accuracy of the script or what he should wear, did the Minister or his office discuss any aspect of this self-promotion with the Prime Minister, or with anyone from his office or department, including the Cabinet Office, given the requirements of the <em>Cabinet Manual</em><strong></strong> relating to perceived conflicts of interest?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: The member clearly misheard the answer to the previous question. The Minister’s office—naturally, with the Minister—was concerned as to the accuracy of the scripts, not TVNZ itself. As to the other matters, communications within the Government are going along just well and fine, thank you very much.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon David Cunliffe</strong>: Does he think it is “a good look” for him as a shareholding Minister in TVNZ to be spending taxpayers’ money on a broadcast promoting his own views called
 <em>Plain English</em><strong></strong>, when that title mimics the title of his own political National Party email newsletter?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: I simply say that sometimes one cannot help good luck.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Did the invitation from Television New Zealand come before or after he used a seven-letter word beginning with “f”, followed by a four-letter word beginning with “c”, in a conversation with the person in charge of editorial policy for Television New Zealand?</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Rodney Hide</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I do not believe that question is within the Standing Orders; it certainly is not within the decorum of this House, and I struggle to see what possible point Trevor Mallard MP could be trying to make.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I do not need to hear further on the point of order. I waited to see how members of the House would react to that particular question, because it was patently obvious to anyone who heard it what was meant. It certainly, in my view, was right on the boundaries of whether it should be allowed in this House, and that a member objected to it is, I think, grounds to invite the member to reword his question. I do not want him to lose a supplementary question, but I think we cannot allow that language to stand in the House when a member has objected to it. If the member could reword his question, so that its language does not offend.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Did the invitation to appear on the programme come before or after he swore at the person in charge of Television New Zealand editorial policy and thereby put pressure on a company that he is an ownership Minister of?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: I doubt that question would meet many of the requirements of the Standing Orders, given that it was so full of assumption and assertion. But what I can say is that, in order for an accurate answer to be given, I suggest the member put the question down as a written question, so that all members can know exactly on what date what took place.</p>
