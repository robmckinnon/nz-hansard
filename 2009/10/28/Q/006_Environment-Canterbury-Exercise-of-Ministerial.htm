        <strong>6.
 </strong>
        <strong>JO GOODHEW (National—Rangitata)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister for the Environment</strong>: Will he use his powers under section 24A of the Resource Management Act 1991 to investigate the poor performance of Environment Canterbury?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:34:02"></a>
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH (Minister for the Environment)</strong>
        <strong>:</strong> Today I have announced a formal investigation into Environment Canterbury under section 24A, and in parallel with action by my colleague the Minister of Local Government. Environment Canterbury performed 84th of 84 councils in processing resource consents and has not performed well in developing plans for managing Canterbury’s natural resources. The Government has received strong submissions from Canterbury MPs and mayors, including the member, for intervention. The powers have previously not been used, but are necessary to get Environment Canterbury back on track.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jo Goodhew</strong>: What consultation has the Minister undertaken with Environment Canterbury regarding the intervention, and what has been its response?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: Back in June, I wrote to the eight worst-performing councils in respect of non-compliance with the Resource Management Act. I received a constructive response from Environment Canterbury, and met with it to further discuss these issues. I, along with my colleague Rodney Hide, met again yesterday with the chair and the chief executive of Environment Canterbury to consult on the terms of reference for the investigation. I am encouraged that it has welcomed the review, accepts that it has problems, and is committed to working with the Government to put things right at Environment Canterbury.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Shane Jones</strong>: Will this review consider the disestablishment of the regional council or the removal of some its current resource management functions?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: No. I would be happy to table the terms of reference. This Government is committed to working with Environment Canterbury to ensure that it is able to meet its statutory and important functions under both the Local Government Act and the Resource Management Act.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Amy Adams</strong>: What submissions has the Minister received from other Canterbury councils on problems with Environment Canterbury, and has he considered their perspective in the terms of reference for this investigation?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: The Minister of Local Government and I received a letter on 18 September from Canterbury mayors concerning pressure points between them and Environment Canterbury. Mr Hide and I have subsequently met with the Canterbury mayors. The Canterbury mayors’ concerns are reflected in the Minister of Local Government asking the Department of Internal Affairs to conduct a non-statutory assessment of the council to look at the wider issues. We are looking forward to receiving the review report in February next year.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Shane Jones</strong>: Does he agree with David Carter that irrigating the Canterbury Plains is a significant issue, and that there was “more to infrastructure than just Auckland roads”; and how will this review simplify the process of water allocation,
 which is an issue obviously vexing MPs in the National Party with associations with Canterbury?</p>
      <a name="page_6"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: It is this Government’s view that irrigation and water management are huge strategic issues for Canterbury. The problems within Environment Canterbury have been a barrier and a problem in developing proper plans for the management of water resources, from both an environmental and a development perspective. It is our view that Environment Canterbury getting its act together is an important part of enabling Canterbury to get the very best from those important natural resources.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Jacqui Dean</strong>: What advice has the Minister for the Environment given him on the performance of other local authorities, and is he taking any action in respect of other councils to improve delivery of the Resource Management Act?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: The Ministry for the Environment survey on local government performance identified eight councils that were performing poorly. I wrote to those councils requesting that they identify what they were going to do to improve their performance. Following these responses, the Ministry for the Environment has recommended that in addition to investigating Environment Canterbury, I also investigated the Far North District Council under section 24A of the Resource Management Act. Today I notified the Far North District Council of that decision. I note that that investigation is constrained to the Resource Management Act issues, and does not involve a more formal review of the Local Government Act functions, which are the responsibility of Rodney Hide.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>John Boscawen</strong>: In terms of his working with his colleague the Hon Rodney Hide on this investigation, how are the Minister of Local Government and the Minister for the Environment coordinating efforts to ensure that Environment Canterbury lifts its game?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon Dr NICK SMITH</strong>: Rodney Hide and I have been working closely on this issue, as have our officials. The investigation is a joint effort, covering both the Resource Management Act and the Local Government Act functions. The Minister of Local Government and I share a view that this council is underperforming and is holding Canterbury back. We consider that interventions such as this undertaking, as well as the broader reforms that the Minister of Local Government is advancing, are needed to lift the performance of this important sector.</p>
