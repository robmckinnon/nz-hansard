    <div class="SubsQuestion">
      <p class="SubsQuestion">
        <strong>10.
 </strong>
        <strong>LYNNE PILLAY (Labour)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister for Disability Issues</strong>: Does she stand by all her statements as Minister for Disability Issues on the
 <em>Q+A</em><strong></strong> programme?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:50:30"></a>
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG (Associate Minister for Disability Issues)</strong> on behalf of the
 <strong>Minister for Disability Issues</strong>:
 Yes.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Lynne Pillay</strong>: Does she stand by her statement that disabled people do not get enough now, and that she would be very opposed to slashing spending on modifying vehicles and homes for disabled New Zealanders, and will she ensure that this Government does not slash 20 percent of the funding for those modifications as it plans to do?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG</strong>: The Minister has received no specific information about the 20 percent cut to the accident compensation Budget spend on modifying homes or
 vehicles. She is, however, advised that in the last 8 years the cost to the accident compensation scheme of adapting houses has increased by 500 percent, and the cost of adapting vehicles has increased by 400 percent. We need to scrutinise individual cases, such as claims for modifying secondary or holiday homes, or for modifying newly constructed two-storey houses for wheelchair-bound clients, to ensure value for money.</p>
      <a name="page_10"></a>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Lynne Pillay</strong>: How can she claim any effectiveness for her ministerial committee when it has met only once under her watch, and disabled people have ended up with less, not more?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG</strong>: On this side of the House, we understand quality, not quantity. The 9 long years of Labour Government did little for the disability sector.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Kelvin Davis</strong>: Why is she supporting legislation that will cut entitlements for disabled Māori, given her concerns that many cannot even take part in their own culture due to a lack of disability facilities on marae?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG</strong>: Indeed, the Minister is concerned about the low number of Māori claimants, and their not understanding their entitlement to accident compensation after 9 long years of Labour Government. The previous Government did little to ensure that Māori claimants know their rights.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Kelvin Davis</strong>: How does she reconcile her concern that disabled Māori do not get the accident compensation support they are entitled to with her decision to support legislation that will reduce entitlements and will see disabled Māori get less, not more?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG</strong>: It would pay for that member to listen, and not repeat the same question. The Minister’s concern is that after 9 long years—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: When asked a question—and it was a reasonable question about reconciling what the questioner perceived to be two conflicting positions—I think the Minister should attempt to answer it, rather than launching into an attack on the questioner.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG</strong>: The Minister remains very concerned about Māori claimants’ low level of understanding of their rights and the lack of promotion of their understanding after 9 long years of the previous Labour Government, which did little to reverse that situation.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Carmel Sepuloni</strong>: Given that she is the Minister for Disability Issues for all New Zealanders, has she secured any additional funding for Pacific people, who are overrepresented in workplace injuries and who will suffer more under these cuts?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG</strong>: The disability portfolio is one of advocacy and the funding is spread over many portfolios. That is why the Government set up the ministerial committee for the disability sector to better coordinate efforts—unlike the Labour Government, which wasted 9 long years—</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The Minister was asked whether she had secured more funding for a particular purpose, and some attempt to respond to that question would have been helpful. If she had not launched into a further attack on the Opposition, I might have been able to forget the fact, but if she is going to launch into an attack on the Opposition she should at least answer the question.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the additional opportunity. The portfolio of the Minister for Disability Issues is to make sure that advocacy is being championed, and that is why the ministerial committee has been set up. The funding for the disability sector is vested in each individual portfolio.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I invite Carmel Sepuloni to repeat her question. There will not be any loss of questions.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Carmel Sepuloni</strong>: Given that she is the Minister for Disability Issues for all New Zealanders, has she secured any additional funding for Pacific people, who are overrepresented in workplace injuries and who will suffer more under these cuts?</p>
      <a name="page_11"></a>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG</strong>: Indeed, the Minister is concerned that all New Zealanders get their entitlement and are well looked after. The ministerial committee for the disability sector will look after all New Zealanders.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Carmel Sepuloni</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I think my question was very clear and I feel the Minister has not addressed it. I need a yes or no with regard to whether the Minister has secured any additional funding—[<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>]</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I say to the Government benches that they must not interject like that during a point of order. The member asked her question very clearly, and although tradition has it that we cannot necessarily extract a yes or no from a Minister, to simply say in response to that question that the Minister is concerned for all New Zealanders does not even come close, in my view, to providing an answer to the question. Rather than having further opportunity to comment, it would be helpful if the Minister would give some kind of answer to the question.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon PANSY WONG</strong>: We are championing issues for all New Zealanders, including Pacific New Zealanders, and all good efforts are being championed by the ministerial committee.</p>
