        <strong>8.
 </strong>
        <strong>Hon TREVOR MALLARD (Labour—Hutt South)</strong> to the
 <strong>Minister of Education</strong>: What will be the change in the Government’s support for professional advice for science in primary schools between 2009 and 2010?</p>
      <p class="SubsAnswer">
        <a name="time_14:40:09"></a>
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH (Deputy Prime Minister)</strong> on behalf of the
 <strong>Minister of Education</strong>: In 2009 approximately $908,000 was used to support professional development in science in primary and secondary schools. I am advised that this figure cannot be broken down into separate primary and secondary school figures until hours are reported at the end of the year. The primary schools’ 2010 professional support will be focused on literacy and numeracy, because students need to be able to read, write, and do maths in order to be able to achieve in science.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Is she aware that as we speak, New Zealand’s soon to be made redundant world-leading science advisers are being approached by international recruiters, and are likely to be lost for ever to New Zealand?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: The Government and the Minister have made clear decisions about the priorities, which are to focus on numeracy and literacy.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: In light of
 her reply
 on Government priorities, did she suggest to the Minister of Finance that at least three, and possibly six, science advisers could be employed for another year if he repaid the money he received as a result of his declarations that Dipton is his primary place of residence?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: Well, as the member will know, I did repay the money.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>David Shearer</strong>: Did she consult with Dr Peter Gluckman before deciding to cut the funding for primary schools’ science advice and professional development; if so, did he support her proposal; if not, why not?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: I am not aware of the answer to that question, but I can tell members that the Government is unashamed about its priorities to teach all our children to read, write, and do maths. That is why we are implementing a national standards policy, and that policy is strongly supported throughout the country.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Did she suggest to the Minister of Finance that at least three, and possibly six, science advisers could be employed for another year if he repaid the money he received as a result of his declarations—over 10 years—that Dipton is his primary place of residence?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: The Minister of Education has spoken to me often about the priorities and pressures in education. She has the unfortunate job of cleaning up a mess
 left by the previous Government, which left a large number of unfunded commitments and uncontrolled expenditure. We have to make decisions about priorities.</p>
      <a name="page_12"></a>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I think it is a relatively simple point of order. I think that right from the beginning of the answer, when the Minister said “The Minister of Education has spoken to me”, he did the entire answer as the Minister of Finance, and did not answer the question of whether the Minister of Education approached him on a particular subject.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: I hear the member’s point, and it is an interesting point that the Minister is answering on behalf of the Minister of Education. Could he reword his answer to make sure it complies with the fact that he is answering of behalf of the Minister? Would it be possible to reword that answer?</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: OK, I will put it the other way around. The Minister of Education talks to the Minister of Finance all the time about the mess that she has to clean up, which was left by the previous Government. It left layers of programmes that were uncoordinated and had unfocused priorities, and it had a whole lot of unfunded commitments in education.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Again, it is a very simple point of order. It was a very simple question, and it asked whether a particular matter had been raised with the Minister of Finance by the Minister of Education. That was not addressed.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: If the Minister is keen to answer further, I am happy for him to respond to that point of order.</p>
      <p class="ContinueSpeech">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: No, because the Minister spends her time talking with the Minister of Finance about the mess left by the previous Labour Government in education, with unfunded commitments, layers of programmes that do not work, and no focus on getting children to learn properly and every child having that right.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I know this has been a very political area, but we have a Minister of Finance who continues to declare that Dipton is his primary place of residence.</p>
      <p class="Interjection">
        <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: The member will resume his seat right now. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] I am on my feet, and there will be no further interjections from the Hon Tau Henare. That is not a point of order. Debating that matter has nothing to do with order in this House, and it is not a point of order. It will cease.</p>
      <p class="SupQuestion">
        <strong>Dr Kennedy Graham</strong>: Does she agree with the British Conservative Party’s education spokesperson that “A broad
 and demanding curriculum—far from undermining reading, writing and arithmetic—reinforces attainment in these core skills.”, or is it the case that under her watch the three Rs really stand for “reduce, regiment, and ruin” the curriculum?</p>
      <p class="SupAnswer">
        <strong>Hon BILL ENGLISH</strong>: The answer to that is no. Of course New Zealand does maintain a broad and demanding curriculum, and the tens of thousands of teachers who are out there teaching it will continue to do so.</p>
