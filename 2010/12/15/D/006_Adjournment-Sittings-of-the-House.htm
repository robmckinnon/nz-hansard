          </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="a">This has been a very interesting year, and before I make any reflective comments on that, I would like to first thank you, Mr Speaker, for presiding over this House along with your presiding officers and for the way in which you have ensured that we operate in the way that is fitting for a Parliament of this nature. That is greatly appreciated not only by members of the House but also by many, as you are no doubt aware, outside of the House as well. Thank you for that and we wish you a restful festive season and all the best for 2011. I also thank the messengers; the security staff; the Hansard Office staff; everyone in the Clerk’s Office, particularly Mary Harris, the Clerk, who has served us so well again for one more year; those in the Parliamentary Counsel Office; the House staff who look after us here; the Bellamy’s staff, whom I particularly appreciate; the VIP drivers; my electorate office staff; my ministerial office staff; Ministerial Services, the Parliamentary Service, the Diplomatic Protection Squad; and the many others who make this place work, including all of those who clean our offices during the evenings and keep the grounds looking tidy outside. We wish them all a happy and festive Christmas season and all the best for 2011.</p>
        <p class="a">This year, 2010, has, to say the least, been an interesting one. Not only has the Government been able to progress an awful lot of legislation but also we have had to
 deal with two very unsavoury incidents that have affected the lives of many, many New Zealanders. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] I take that back, members are right to say that the word is not appropriate—not unsavoury, but—</p>
        <a name="page_16475"></a>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Hon Simon Power</strong>: Difficult.</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: —difficult and tragic. The first was the Canterbury earthquake, of course, when so many people were displaced for a short time but then got back in their homes once they realised they were safe. To put that incident into scale, worldwide it was the fourth-biggest earthquake incident insurance-wise since 1970. It is the third-biggest insurance payout for any disaster in the world this year, so it has a magnitude that is quite considerable. It is interesting, when we look at other earthquakes of its size, how totally miraculous it was that no one died, and that was the result, I think, of not only the building code that has been mentioned so many times but also the time of day that it occurred. A similar event in Kobe killed some 6,500 people, and in other events of similar size the death toll has run to hundreds of thousands. So there is some satisfaction that we were prepared well enough to avoid that loss of life, but the loss of property will take quite some time to recover from.</p>
        <p class="a">Then there was the terrible tragedy at Pike River Coal on the West Coast, which certainly touched the hearts of all New Zealanders. It was very raw for people because they could see, night by night on the television, people who were in a dreadful situation not of their own making and quite unable to be helped, and that, unfortunately, continues. Our best wishes and our hearts go out to the families who will have a lonely Christmas this year. I think that the words the Rt Hon John Key offered at the memorial service, particularly to the mothers of the children who were affected, will be of some comfort to them, although precious little, in fact.</p>
        <p class="a">I do not want to sound trivial but there have been other disasters this year as well. One of those would have to be the incredibly poor poll showing of our opponents on the other side of the House—</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Grant Robertson</strong>: Such a statesman!</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: I know that they are calling on me now to stay as a statesman and keep talking in these general, broad, and above-the-issue terms, but I think it only appropriate that we record the fact that this has been a year that has been an abject disaster for Labour—an abject disaster. It started to become apparent how bad it was when its communications plan was revealed earlier this year, and Clare Curran attempted to present Phil Goff as “fresh”, “funky”, and “forward-looking”. From there it has just slowly gone downhill. Perhaps it came to its climax with Labour’s dreadful confusion over whether New Zealand should have supported the production of the
 <em>Hobbit
 </em><strong></strong>movies remaining in New Zealand. I think it is sad that a party that once claimed to be the doyen of the creative side of New Zealand could have lost it in such a way.</p>
        <p class="a">I suggest that some of the members on the other side might want to spend some time over the Christmas holidays getting in touch with their creative side. I suggest that Mr Hodgson goes back to Dunedin and gets in touch with Mr Taylor and his unit down there and makes a little programme called “<em>CSI: Dunedin”</em><strong></strong>, which he could, of course, star in—he has shown his credentials in that way in recent weeks. I suggest that going back to South Auckland, Mr Goff might like to get hold of some of those production houses. He is the perfect leading man for a remake of
 <em>Cold Case.
 </em><strong></strong>Then there is his nemesis Mr Cunliffe—or Mr Caygill, depending on what day of the week it is. Mr Cunliffe is a guy who I think would be perfect for a starring role in
 <em>The Mentalist</em><strong></strong>, although I understand from his office that he is also considering the lead part in
 <em>Two and a Half Men.</em><strong></strong></p>
        <p class="a">Shane Jones, the self-confessed movie buff, will make a new feature film, known as
 <em>“A Mighty Tōtara Rises Again”</em><strong></strong>. This will, of course, be a sequel to his well-known
 classic “<em>Hung Parliament</em><strong></strong>”. Clayton Cosgrove might like to do something with the title “<em>WWF</em><strong></strong>”—all bluff, all bluster, lots of lycra, and absolutely no winners there. We know that one of the most creative people in Labour is Trevor Mallard. It has to be conceded that he is very creative. We look at those blogs—there he is out there, a poor man’s David Farrar, making up all and everything we could possibly imagine to try and indicate that he is on top of the job. It is much easier sitting in front of a little—what do they call those things—keyboard and making it up than actually doing any work.</p>
        <a name="page_16476"></a>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Hon Members</strong>: Ha, ha!</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: Well, look, I do not mind admitting that I am a bit behind the times. I see that that member has an iPad; one does not need a keyboard with that.</p>
        <p class="a">One of the highlights of the year for me was to be confronted with my advancing years when I spoke to the Youth Parliament and suggested to them that when I was younger we did not have such wonderful things that they enjoy, like Sony Walkmans. I can assure members that that brought down the House, because there was not a single person in that Youth Parliament who was born at the time the Sony Walkman was a popular item for people to carry around.</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Hon Simon Power</strong>: What?</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>Hon GERRY BROWNLEE</strong>: Yes, Sony Walkman, that is right. I tell Simon Power that he is a young man, too. In the end it is that lack of experience that is holding him back.</p>
        <p class="a">I say to our coalition partners that it has been a delight to work with them this year. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] No, it has, truly. If I had more time, I would go into some of the delights of the discussions with Rodney, Roger, Heather, and Rahui. It has been fantastic. I have loved our discussions. I thank those members. I do hope that they enjoy the Christmas season and have a great New Year.</p>
        <p class="a">I finally want to acknowledge the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon John Key, for his extraordinary leadership of this nation. The fact is that that leadership is enforced not only by his own party and by the coalition partners who work with him but also by large numbers of New Zealanders who are very supportive of his style and the leadership he is showing for this country.</p>
        <p class="a">To all of my constituents in Ilam, I say thank you for all of their forbearance this year. It has been a difficult one. I look forward to 2011 and continuing, beyond the election, to serve that great electorate. Thank you.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Speech">
        <p class="Speech">
          <a name="time_16:34:40"></a>
          <strong>Hon PHIL GOFF (Leader of the Opposition)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> The Leader of the House made an effort to be statesman-like—it lasted 1.5 minutes. Then he got into a range of descriptions of film shows and who should be starring in them. Of course the member is the self-proclaimed star of
 <em>Free Willy</em><strong></strong>. There is a sequel to that about
 <em>Whale Rider</em><strong></strong> that I will not go into in this House.</p>
        <p class="a">We are now 2 years into the term of this Parliament, 2 years into the term of this National Government, and it is time that the National Government took responsibility for what is happening in this country. We had a tax switch this year; this is the year of the tax switch. Bill English stood up and said the Government would turbocharge the New Zealand economy—turbocharge the New Zealand economy. Well, Fran O’Sullivan writes for the
 <em>New Zealand Herald
 </em><strong></strong>and she is known to be a supporter of the Government. She reflected on that. The turbocharge, she said, would actually be more of a fizzer. This is a tax switch that did not work. This was a tax swindle, because we were told that it would compensate New Zealanders for increased costs and they would be better off. Of course one could not believe that, because this was from the same Government that said very sincerely, in a Bill Clinton - type way, “National will not be increasing GST.”—and National did not have relationships with anyone on that.</p>
        <a name="page_16477"></a>
        <p class="a">The truth of the matter is that this Government has governed for the privileged. It has governed for the privileged. That is why 42 percent of the tax cuts went to the top 10 percent of income earners. What about the people whom I will acknowledge soon, like the cleaners in this building? What did they get? The bottom 20 percent got just 2 percent of the tax cuts. Do members know the real disgrace about the tax switch, which came out in the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update? The tax rewards for the wealthy were paid for by borrowing—paid for by borrowing. You know, this Government will borrow, according to Treasury figures, $3 billion to reward the people who receive the highest incomes. You know, there are 650 millionaires in this country. What did they get? They received over $1,000 a week extra in the hand. But if we ask constituents in Wainuiōmata, in Miramar, or in Mt Roskill, the people on the median wage, what they got, they say they received $5 a week. It is $5 a week as against $1,000 a week. It is a disgrace.</p>
        <p class="a">This Government must bear responsibility for the figures released by Treasury this week. There is a blowout in the deficit of $2.5 billion. At the start of this year—not even at the start; it was in May, 6 months ago—John Key said the deficit was at the maximum level that the Government could take it to. Six months later it is $2.5 billion more than it was then, and who is responsible for that? The National Government. John Key got up in the House today and said it was because of the global economic crisis. You know, Mr Speaker—you have been a trade Minister, and I have been a trade Minister—this country is earning more than it has ever earned before, because it has the highest terms of trade ever. Money is flooding into this country, but it is not going into the pockets of average New Zealanders—the people now paying $2 a litre for petrol, the people paying $22 a week more to rent a house in Auckland than they were last year, the people whose rates are going up, the people paying 12 percent more for their fresh fruit and vegetables than they were this time last year.</p>
        <p class="a">This Government says it is against taking GST off fruit and vegetables. Gerry Brownlee should know more than most people do that in this country one child in four is already obese by the time they enter school. This country has the third-highest obesity rate in the world, and the least we could do is to give families the chance to afford decent food for their kids.</p>
        <p class="a">I want to talk about employment, too, because this year ends on a sad note for a lot of New Zealanders: 150,000 New Zealanders are out of work. I ask the members across the other side of the House which ones of them feel proud of the fact that nearly 50 percent of our Pacific and Māori teenage girls are out of work, and not in education and training. Who feels proud about that? More than one-third of our teenage Māori and Pacific boys are out of work. I say to this Government that after 2 years in office, the unemployment rate is three times the rate that it inherited from the previous Labour Government, and that is a disgrace. Members on that side of the House are not doing their job.</p>
        <p class="a">The financial management of this country has been a disaster. I ask Gerry Brownlee why the Australians have created 350,000 new jobs this year—54,000 in November alone—and all that his Government has come up with is some gimmicks. There was the cycleway. How many jobs were there from the cycleway? Was it 200? Did it get as high as that?</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Hon Member</strong>: 200.</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>Hon PHIL GOFF</strong>: It was 200. When we talk about unemployment figures, we are not talking about statistics. In the supermarket in my electorate that opened this year there were 150 new jobs—and I welcomed that—but 2,700 people in my area lined up to apply for them. They were not highly paid jobs, but 2,700 people applied for them.
 Those people asked me why Paula Bennett blamed them for being unemployed, when there are not enough jobs to go around.</p>
        <a name="page_16478"></a>
        <p class="a">This Government has failed. It has failed on its own measures. It said it would close the income gap with Australia. Do members remember that? That was the promise before the election. What has happened since the election? That gap has grown by 37 percent. That is a mark of the failure of this Government. The wage gap between New Zealand and Australia has grown by 37 percent. Which members of the National Government and their coalition partners are proud of that achievement? That is absolutely appalling.</p>
        <p class="a">There is no plan to build our economy into a stronger economy. There is a plan, however, to make cuts. Why is it that the
 <em>New Zealand Herald
 </em><strong></strong>day after day runs cases of people who have suffered accidents and are now told that under Nick Smith, ACC regards the outcome of an accident as something that results from a degenerative disease—a degenerative disease? Why is it that the number of people who challenge ACC decisions has trebled and many of them are winning? Also, this Government is surreptitiously—and not so surreptitiously—cutting money for our kids. In early childhood education $400 million was cut. Fewer kids will progress, and fewer kids will be successful in their education and be able to make the most of their lives. That is something else for National to be proud of!</p>
        <p class="a">I want to acknowledge the two tragedies that have affected New Zealand. First of all, there was the Christchurch earthquake. I have spent many days in Christchurch, and I acknowledge the work that Gerry Brownlee has done, as I acknowledge the work that all of my colleagues and Jim Anderton have done in helping people whose lives have been disrupted and who have suffered through that earthquake. I just hope, I say to Mr Brownlee, that now that the television cameras have gone the promises made apparently so sincerely will be upheld in the years to come. I hope that that is the case.</p>
        <p class="a">The miracle of the Christchurch earthquake was that no one was killed, but tragically across the alps 29 miners lost their lives at Pike River. I think that everyone was sincere when they offered their support and their sympathy to the bereaved family members who had lost their husbands, their sons, and their brothers. And I say, absolutely sincerely, that if there is any way in which we can recover the remains of those whose lives have been lost, then we have an obligation as a country, as a community, and as a Parliament to actually retrieve those remains. Cost should not be a problem. The promise was made that their sons, their brothers, and their husbands would be brought out if that was humanly possible, and I hope that the Government will honour that commitment. If it does, it will have the support of this side of the House and the support of all New Zealanders.</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">It remains for me today to acknowledge those whose work has contributed to the functioning of this House: your office, Mr Speaker, the Clerk’s Office, Bellamy’s, the cleaners, the library, the messengers, the security staff, our electorate office staff, our executive assistants, and our media and research people. I acknowledge the families of parliamentarians. They have to put up with a lot because of the jobs that we do. I offer members of the House and all New Zealanders a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year.</p>

          <a name="time_16:45:28"></a>
          <strong>Dr KENNEDY GRAHAM (Green)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> The year 2010 has come and gone, at least in a parliamentary sense. I convey the Green Party’s thanks to you, Mr Speaker, for your patience, fortitude, and skill in handling this august, if rather unruly, institution. I thank all staff who labour to keep us functioning, but who get no public recognition. Their courtesy and devotion to their jobs are unfailing, and we thank them for making ours not only possible but more pleasant through their good nature. I acknowledge the ushers who greet us, the security staff who protect us, Bellamy’s who feed us, the librarians
 who inform us, and the messengers, travel staff, and everyone in the Clerk’s Office. Not least I thank the select committee staff, who strive to help us to think clearly and sensibly, which is not an easy task. Also, I thank our own party staff, executive assistants, out-of-Parliament people, and administrative, research, and media staff.</p>
        <a name="page_16479"></a>
        <p class="a">As we bask in the sun and reflect on the year, most of us will combine a sense of achievement with some apprehension about what we have not achieved, particularly, I think, in respect of climate change, from Copenhagen to Cancun. The year 2010 has seen human drama around the world and here in New Zealand. We might ask where we are heading as a nation and, indeed, as a global community.</p>
        <p class="a">We bipeds are a strange mix of brilliance and stupidity, and I do not mean just the Greens. We flew our first solar-powered plane, yet we pumped carbon into the atmosphere faster than ever. We trapped antimatter in the European Organization for Nuclear Research—or CERN—Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, yet we cannot rid ourselves of malaria. We clocked 10 years of continuous living in space and it is 41 years since we walked on the moon, yet we are killing life here on Earth.</p>
        <p class="a">Our shrinking global village, more transparent now through WikiLeaks, reveals some oddities as well. Dubai completed the world’s tallest building, not much short of a kilometre high into the sky. It is gleaming and beautiful, yet it cost $1.5 billion, which could have gone into malaria eradication. A major slump in the Dubai rental market has meant that it has a vacancy rate of 92 percent. So we have a lot to learn and we do not seem to be learning it in time.</p>
        <p class="a">The world has suffered natural disasters this year: the earthquakes in Haiti, Chile, and China, and our own miracle in Christchurch, where a 7.1 magnitude quake close to the city returned no fatalities. Tragically, we were not so fortunate at Pike River coalfield. The volcanic eruption in Iceland gave us a foretaste of the disruption the global community will experience when climate change reaches danger level. Let me assure ACT that such a specific event is not necessarily due to climate change; neither are the floods in Pakistan and Australia, the forest fires in Russia and Australia, the landslides in Mexico, or the drought in China, Africa, and Australia. What I do know is that the Optimum Population Trust concludes that Australia is overpopulated and that its optimal population may be around 10 million. It may be right; it may be wrong. But it raises issues that can no longer be ignored. It seems that 6.7 billion on the planet may be too many for Earth.</p>
        <p class="a">Here in New Zealand we remain part of the global problem of unsustainable living. Humanity is overshooting the planet’s ecological capacity by 40 percent. If there is one thing that defines the Green Party, it is sustainability. The truth is that we in the Green Party love this country too much to trash it for the sake of a few dollars. We prefer to look after it for its intrinsic value.</p>
        <p class="a">Five overarching green goals drive our politics in 2010. We promote a smart, green economy for New Zealand. We believe a fairer society will be better for everyone, including the rich. We love the land and we want to protect it. We embrace honest politics, and we cherish safe and healthy food for ourselves and our children. Each Green MP has worked in different ways throughout 2010 to realise those goals.</p>
        <p class="a">The fundamental divide between the Green Party and the Government concerns economic growth. The Government continues to cite economic growth as its mantra, neurotically seeking signs of recovery back to a growth pattern like a drunkard reaching for the bottle to get through the hangover. It talks of a balance between economic opportunity and environment responsibility, but continuous growth will never result in balance. Rather, it will result in a trade-off in which degradation trumps conservation. This year the Green Party more assertively promoted ecological economics as the alternative to the traditional neo-classical economics that underpins that growth
 addiction. The sustainable economics conference we convened in the Legislative Council Chamber just last month brought together economists and environmentalists for a dialogue over the relationship between these policy areas and the need to strike a consensus among parties. I thank Minister Nick Smith and Labour’s David Cunliffe for joining us in agreeing to participate in the dialogue, joining with me on a panel on the political perceptions of sustainability. This could be seen as the beginning of a constructive dialogue between National, Labour, and the Green Party over a 21st century macroeconomic policy that will preserve the planet and bring security and prosperity for all. I do not think there is a more important or constructive thing we could aspire to do together.</p>
        <a name="page_16480"></a>
        <p class="a">Russel Norman voiced the concerns of many Kiwis when it comes to the foreign ownership of New Zealand’s strategic assets. We were pleased to see the Government keep the current guidelines for the Overseas Investment Office after it originally wanted to weaken the rules. Russel Norman has also critiqued the Government over trade policy, especially the patent absurdities of the secretive Trans-Pacific Partnership. We trust that the Government will see the light on this issue next year. Dave Clendon has been promoting sustainable business throughout the country, and has proposed to this House a sustainable development commission.</p>
        <p class="a">It is time for a fair society. Metiria Turei’s Mind the Gap campaign highlighted the obscene inequalities that have developed here in recent decades, and the need for a sense of decency and an egalitarian ethic. The home insulation programme that Jeannette Fitzsimons pioneered with Labour continues to live under this Government. I shall maintain that cooperation with Minister Brownlee into 2011. In a similar vein, Gareth Hughes’ warm and healthy rentals campaign, including a member’s bill to that effect, promises to transform for the better the way that Kiwis live in their homes. A successful Supplementary Order Paper by Kevin Hague will ensure that the Health Quality and Safety Commission can rely on public funding. Catherine Delahunty’s proposal for a disabilities commissioner persuaded the Government to establish just such an office.</p>
        <p class="a">We are working to protect our land. Metiria Turei helped to save our national parks from mining. The Government changed its plans because Kiwis love their parks. I pay a special thanks to the 47,000 who signed her petition. Public opinion also prompted action to stop factory farming in the Mackenzie Basin, an iconic landscape that most of us want to protect. Russel Norman broke the factory farming story and campaigned alongside environmental and animal welfare groups to save the Mackenzie Basin. Russel was effective also over the Mangatainoka River. Fonterra reconsidered a plan to dump wastewater in the river after we urged it to show leadership and stop polluting. Catherine Delahunty persuaded TradeMe to join us in saving rainforests and to support the local timber industry. From this week it will allow the sale of new kwila furniture only with a sustainability certificate. Kevin Hague is pursuing with the Government a $4 million pilot project to protect New Zealand forests and native species with better pest control. Kevin is also continuing to work with the Prime Minister on a national cycleway.</p>
        <p class="a">The voting public wants Parliament, above all, to practice honest politics. It was the Green Party, under Metiria Turei’s leadership, that led the charge to clean up the system for MPs’ pay and expenses. Last year the Greens voluntarily released our own expenses. By late 2010, Parliament had agreed to adopt our policy of an independent authority for MPs’ pay. Metiria Turei also played a role in convincing the Government to put in place campaign spending caps for elections, as well as for the MMP referendum. Keith Locke’s Head of State Referenda Bill focused attention on how New Zealand wishes to structure its constitutional arrangements in the 21st century. It will live for another day.
 Our intervention on the Courts (Remote Participation) Bill helped to ensure that defendants retain the right to be present in a criminal trial. I pay tribute to Minister Simon Power for his judgment on this issue. My new Register of Pecuniary Interests of Judges Bill is attracting National and Labour support. I look forward to working with Chris Finlayson on this.</p>
        <a name="page_16481"></a>
        <p class="a">We cherish safe and healthy food. Our animal welfare standards jumped with Sue Kedgley’s measure on the phase-out of sow crates being adopted by the Government. The Green Party was acknowledged for a decade of work to stop the cruelty.</p>
        <p class="a">Lest this sound like so much braggadocio, let me assure this House that we do not believe we run the country, but we do set the agenda for change, and one day we shall run the country.</p>

          <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE (Leader—ACT)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> First of all, on behalf of the ACT Party I wish you, Mr Speaker, and your wife a very happy Christmas. Also, on behalf of all New Zealand, I thank you for your service as Speaker. I think everyone appreciates the good humour and the grace you have brought to the job of Speaker, your fairness in the application of the rules, and your sense of appreciation of the importance of Parliament in any functioning democracy. Certainly, you have improved question time out of sight for the people of New Zealand, if not for Government Ministers. Certainly, you have made question time relevant, and I thank you for that.</p>
        <p class="a">I acknowledge in this Parliament—and I am sure others will appreciate this—our VIP Transport Service driver, Jimmy, who has retired after 33 years of service to sit on the beach at Waihi. I also note the very sad loss of Twiss, who passed away early this year, who was a friend and confidante of us all. It was a sudden and very great loss.</p>
        <p class="a">I acknowledge all the work of Ministerial Services and the Parliamentary Service, in particular the messengers, who have to sit through some pretty mind-numbing speeches—</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Stuart Nash</strong>: Speak for yourself.</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: I was thinking of Mr Nash. I also acknowledge the Hansard team, because not only do they have to sit through those speeches but also they have to type them up. I wish that Mr Nash would think of that more often. But I have noticed that they can take Mr Nash’s speeches and make them read rather well, so I thank the Hansard team.</p>
        <p class="a">I acknowledge the tremendous work throughout the year of Mark Ford and the Auckland Transition Agency in producing the new Auckland Council; the Chief Executive of the Department of Internal Affairs, Brendan Boyle, and his team; and also the staff of the old councils, who worked assiduously to produce a good result in Auckland, and of the new Auckland Council, who are working so well to make it work for the benefit of Auckland and the rest of the country.</p>
        <p class="a">I acknowledge the Prime Minister, John Key, who undoubtedly is doing a fantastic job as Prime Minister, which is acknowledged by the people of New Zealand. As a Minister, I have found him fantastic to work with. I also acknowledge my ministerial colleagues. I acknowledge all the ACT staff in Wellington and in Auckland, and our new MP, Hilary Calvert. I also acknowledge the people of Epsom, who support me as their MP.</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Phil Twyford</strong>: Do they?</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: I hope that one day Mr Twyford can convince the Labour Party to let him stand for a seat in Auckland, and he too can ask people for their vote. I thank the people of Epsom and also all the ACT members and supporters.</p>
        <p class="a">We promised the people of New Zealand that if they voted for us in Epsom and with their party vote it would effect a change of Government and we would go from a Helen Clark - led Government to a John Key - led Government. That happened as a
 consequence of the vote in Epsom and the vote for ACT. We promised the people of New Zealand that ACT would ensure not just a change in Government but also a stable Government, and we have delivered on that. It has not been just a stable Government but also a better Government as a consequence of the party vote for ACT. We have done that.</p>
        <a name="page_16482"></a>
        <p class="a">The highlights for us for the year undoubtedly include ACT’s achievement in passing “three strikes” legislation to ensure that people will be safer in the street. We certainly know that the people of New Zealand have been asking for it for a very long time, and they were delivered it by giving their party vote to ACT. I believe that the change we made in Auckland has been successful, and that it will make a big difference not just to the people of Auckland but also to the people of New Zealand.</p>
        <p class="a">I look forward to, one year, the Labour Party getting positive and starting to make a contribution in our Parliament, instead of sitting there, even on this pleasant day, carping away, miserable in Opposition. I guess they are feeling hurt because the barbecue season is upon them. No one knows that more keenly than Mr Cunliffe and Mr Goff.</p>
        <p class="a">We are also proud of the fact that we have done the work to open up accident compensation to choice and competition. We have opened up the opportunity for more people to get work, through our changes to legislation with regard to the 90-day trial. I must say what a pleasure it has been for me to work in special education and to see how well the special education review that this Government has done has been received by principals, teachers, and parents alike.</p>
        <p class="a">On Saturday we passed into law the establishment of the Productivity Commission, which will no doubt make a big difference to New Zealand.</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Hon Lianne Dalziel</strong>: We did the work—give us some kudos.</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE</strong>: Lianne Dalziel is already shouting her support across the Chamber for the work that the ACT Party has done. I appreciate her support in getting the Productivity Commission up and running. I look forward to next year introducing the Regulatory Responsibility Bill to further clamp down on red tape, and the Taxpayer Rights Bill to get on top of Government spending after years of neglect by the previous Labour Government.</p>
        <p class="a">I appreciate enormously the work the ACT MPs and the ACT team have done in campaigning against not just Labour’s 2004 foreshore and seabed legislation, but also the present Government’s attempt to improve on that legislation, which, in fact, makes it worse. I also appreciate the team campaigning against the emissions trading scheme and ensuring that this Government has a proper review next year so that we do not impose unnecessary costs on New Zealand producers, households, and families to no net advantage to the environment.</p>
        <p class="a">I end by wishing the Labour Party members, the Green Party members, the ACT Party members, the Māori Party members, and the National Party members all the very best for Christmas. Mr Speaker, we look forward to seeing you back in the new year. Once again, we thank you for your service and your work as Speaker. Thank you.</p>

        <p class="Speech">
          <a name="time_17:03:08"></a>
          <strong>Hon Dr PITA SHARPLES (Co-Leader—Māori Party)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> Tēnā koe, Mr Speaker. He hōnore māku ki te tū hei kaikōrero mō te Pāti Māori i tēnei rā.</p>
        <p class="a">[<em>Greetings to you, Mr Speaker. It is an honour for me to stand as the Māori Party’s representative today</em><strong></strong>.]</p>
        <p class="a">As we approach the year’s end we think of those families who will feel the loss of loved ones who are no longer with them. On this day today we acknowledge those who are mourning the passing of two tribal elders: John Haunui, Waikato-Tainui kaumātua for the Māori King, and Rongomaiāniwaniwa Milroy of Ngāti Whakauē and Te Arawa. We recognise, too, the clouds of grief that have hung over Aotearoa this year,
 particularly over the 29 men who lost their lives in the Pike River mine. Our thoughts are with them all.</p>
        <a name="page_16483"></a>
        <p class="a">The adjournment debate is customarily a time for reflection on the good, the bad, and the indifferent that has shaped our year. It has been a big year for the Māori Party, and, indeed, for tangata whenua. Just over 8 months ago I had the privilege of speaking at the opening session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York. I will never forget the awesome sight of more than 2,000 people rising to their feet, dancing in their own custom, to give a rousing ovation endorsing New Zealand’s decision to support the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. That moment in time was a fitting reward for all those who have worked so hard in promoting our indigenous rights and negotiating this agreement at an international level.</p>
        <p class="a">Back home, I am excited by the enthusiasm generated through my announcement in July that I was establishing a special ministerial panel to review te reo Māori, and, in particular, Government spending on the revitalisation of our language. Tangata whenua refuse to relinquish their rights to uphold their mother tongue. It is a mark of identity, of pride, of cultural strength. The Waitangi Tribunal’s report in October challenged the Government to recognise the importance of Māori communities in revitalising the language, emphasising that Māori ownership of the Māori Language Strategy is crucial to its success. This will be an ongoing challenge, which our nation must address, and I am very confident that the panel, led by Professor Tāmati Reedy, will guide us well.</p>
        <p class="a">Another key marker for the Māori Party this year has been the undeniable momentum gained with Whānau Ora. About 160 providers are currently involved in the first wave of Whānau Ora, within 25 provider collectives. The basis of the approach is built around strong, collaborative relationships between providers and whānau, a focus on outcomes not activities, and integrated contracting arrangements. But the key to its success is about whānau transformation. It is about whānau building positive pathways to achieve their aspirations. Whānau Ora returns the power and control to whānau to be resilient and nurturing and to develop their own leadership.</p>
        <p class="a">Alongside of Whānau Ora, I have been proud of the work that has been done in implementing programmes such as Kaitoko Whānau, Ōranga Whānau, and Māra Kai. These programmes are targeted at supporting Māori whānau. Through the Christmas period I am sure that many whānau will be enjoying healthy food from the gardens that they have worked to create for the benefit of the wider community. We have been working steadily to achieve improved outcomes in the justice sectors through the Drivers of Crime initiative. Next year we are looking forward to sharing the success of Whare Ōranga Ake—the kaupapa Māori reintegration units—where the focus will be on prisoners gaining employment and accommodation and improving family and wider social relationships. We look forward to their rehabilitation in the community and their not returning to prison.</p>
        <p class="a">And, of course, we anticipate great things ahead with the work we have been engaged with on the Rugby World Cup, the enterprise and initiative that have emerged from the Māori Economic Taskforce, which we have led this year—particularly after our visit to China, taking Māori businesses—and, of course, the nation-building exercise being undertaken with the constitutional review. I want to acknowledge the initiative of the working-group on constitutional transformation, led by Professor Margaret Mutu and Moana Jackson, which is seeking to develop a moral constitution based on Māori kawa and tikanga, he whakaputanga o te rangatiratanga o Niu Tīreni me Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>
        <p class="a">The active engagement and leadership of iwi, and the momentum generated by our Māori academics, our iwi leaders, our Māori scientists, artists, and educators, our Māori authorities, and our marae have been of profound importance in influencing this
 Government. I acknowledge those groups for all their efforts and thank them for the substantial differences that they make to, ultimately, the fortunes and well-being of whānau, hapū, and iwi.</p>
        <a name="page_16484"></a>
        <p class="a">There is, of course, still much to do. We were not pleased with the super-city process and the way in which Māori representation was diminished. Although we are developing a positive relationship with His Worship Len Brown, the broader issue of Māori participation in the decision-making processes across local government remains still high on our agenda. There are still many challenges ahead, and we look forward with renewed vigour to 2011 and the debate on water, the passage of the Marine and Coastal Area (Tukutai Moana) Bill, and the ongoing issues that confront too many of our whānau—the impact of poverty, family violence, educational underachievement, and so much more.</p>
        <p class="a">The workload is formidable, but the Māori Party is served well by a star team of senior private secretaries, executive assistants, press secretaries, political advisers, out-of-office parliamentary staff, and department secondees, who are some of the most dedicated, hard-working, and consistently positive people I have met. Ka nui te aroha ki a koutou. Around this complex there is a workforce second to none. We are all indebted to the service and support provided to us by the Speaker’s office; the Cabinet Office; the Office of the Clerk, including Hansard, the Bills Office, and the Table Office; the ever-efficient Parliamentary Library service; the expertise and professionalism of Ministerial Services and the Parliamentary Service; our trusted Kaiwhakahaere - Ngā Ratonga Reo Māori; the travel office, whose staff help us serve our constituencies so well; and the cleaners and the finance personnel—both doing their best to ensure we keep everything in order! I often think this place and all its inhabitants would be ripe material for one of those
 <em>Survivor</em><strong></strong> reality shows.</p>
        <p class="a">All of us—left, right, or in the middle—have experienced the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, some of it motivated by political opponents, some of it provoked by an energetic press gallery, some of it of our own doing, but we are also joined by our common humanity. We share the sadness of missing significant family events, we feel the same frustrations, we lose sleep, we have health issues in our whānau, we celebrate our new babies, and we grieve for those we have lost. I want to mihi to so many people who keep our spirits lifted, who support and sustain us through good times and hard. It is done in the everyday conversations we share with the VIP drivers, security staff, the messengers, the buildings staff, and those on reception, at Bellamy’s, in the gym, and, of course, right across this House.</p>
        <p class="a">Finally, there are three special groups of people I want to mention. The first is to recognise the hand of manaaki that was extended to us, the Māori Party, by John Key in inviting the Māori Party to enter into a relationship with National. It has not been without challenge, but we are proud of the way in which our relationship has developed, and a spirit of cooperation has emerged with some of the key Ministers around the table. Secondly, I mihi to Tariana, Te Ururoa, Rahui, and Hone, who sacrifice so much for the good of our people. We have worked so hard, not just for the gains we have achieved but, more important, to retain the faith of our people and to keep our reputation high as the strong and independent Māori voice of Parliament. Sure, we have our disagreements, but we are all for the kaupapa, and we are all for Māori, and that is unbreakable. And, through it all, we acknowledge our wonderful whānau, who are the all-out stars of this
 <em>Survivor</em><strong></strong> series. It is because of their tautoko, their commitment to us and our party, that we are able to do what we do. Words can never reflect adequately the vital role that our whānau play in this Parliament for all of us here.</p>
        <p class="a">Mr Speaker, thank you for your distinguished and impressive leadership in the House. I wish you and all of our honourable colleagues a restful summer with the
 people you love. Mā te Atua koutou me ō koutou whānau e manaaki, e tiaki i te wā o te Kirihimete.</p>

          <strong>CHRIS TREMAIN (National—Napier)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> I rise to speak in the adjournment debate, happy in the knowledge that David Parker has not issued any invitations to Gerry Brownlee to join him on a camping expedition through the Southern Alps this holiday period. I do not know for sure but perhaps, given the public display of affection between the two members at the end of last year, it is still entirely possible. Mr Speaker, I wish you and Alexandra a merry Christmas. I acknowledge all my parliamentary colleagues and wish them a merry Christmas, and also acknowledge all the staff throughout Parliament, and all of our staff in the electorate offices around New Zealand, who certainly do the hard yards for us all as MPs. I particularly wish my electorate a merry Christmas; it is a privilege to be their MP.</p>
        <p class="a">It is a tradition to acknowledge the senior Opposition whip. The Hon Darren Hughes has had an outstanding year, in more ways than one. Although on this side of the House Tony Ryall takes the cake with his daily shirt and tie ensembles, today being no exception I have to say, Darren provides a balance to Tony with his cream and beige, McAndrews Menswear, designer suit combinations—“city fashions at country prices”. That aside, the highlight for me this year was when Darren joined the alpha males—Gerry Brownlee and Maurice Williamson—in his admiration of the beauties from the Miss Universe New Zealand pageant who were present in the gallery. Parliament’s most eligible bachelor wanted to point out that he and Labour joined them in their desire for world peace. Following that, it might have been better if he had given them his phone number, but never mind.</p>
        <p class="a">Parliamentarians around the world are noted for their quick wits, and this House is no different. I recall this year that while debating the Rugby World Cup 2011 (Empowering) Bill, I thought a great way to finish my speech would be to read the broadcast of my father’s try in the 1961 game against the French in a howling gale in Wellington. “At least one Tremain had talent!”, Mr Mallard shouted across the floor. I thank that member. I really appreciated that.</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: They all agreed with me on that side of the House.</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>CHRIS TREMAIN</strong>: Yes, yes. In giving it out, he has taken a bit this year, as well. There was the classic situation when Mr Mallard chose to ask the Prime Minister whether the Prime Minister stood by his spokesperson, Kevin Taylor, in calling Mr Hodgson a name that we will not repeat in the House. Although I am sure the Prime Minister was tempted in his response, he said more diplomatically: “I think Mr Taylor could, in hindsight, have chosen his words more wisely, but I am relieved that he did not use his fists.” I have to say that is one of the only times I have seen Mr Mallard actually stunned to silence in the House—it was a good one.</p>
        <p class="a">One cannot go past the year without raising a few quotes from one of the House’s more prescient and wise members. Members on this side of the House want to acknowledge the honourable Chris Carter as our Opposition “Politician of the Year”. He genuinely is the gift that just keeps on giving, such as his comments this year regarding his leader. Look, Phil Goff is a nice guy, but he just cannot win, and I believe that Labour would do better in next year’s election under a fresh leader. We have been inspired by our selection of the Opposition “Politician of the Year”. I ask the ladies and gentlemen of National to please put their hands together for our Opposition “Politician of the Year”, the gift that keeps on giving, the honourable Chris Carter. Thank you very much, Chris.</p>
        <a name="page_16486"></a>
        <p class="a">One cannot go through the adjournment debate without highlighting the performance of the Parliamentary Sports Trust, which had a great year on the field with games in Tolaga Bay, Murchison, Porirua, the Chatham Islands, and Wanganui. Once again, the team raised tens of thousands of dollars for charities around the country, which is fantastic. A highlight included John Carter’s joke in the Chatham Islands—</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Moana Mackey</strong>: Toastmasters!</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>CHRIS TREMAIN</strong>: —as Moana gave, last night—about a pirate who had his leg and his arm bitten off by a shark. The only problem was that there was a guy in the team playing against us who had had his arm bitten off by a shark. Good on you, JC! It was a bit of a classic.</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: He was involved with Hone, too, wasn’t he?</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>CHRIS TREMAIN</strong>: Yes. It has been a year for the many, not for the few, over on this side of the House. Over on this side of the House we have rolled out policies that have benefited the many, such as our six-point plan, which we continue to implement. I could be here all day acknowledging the Ministers who have done amazing jobs. I do want to mention one Minister whom I think has done an outstanding job, and that is Anne Tolley. In the face of huge opposition from the teacher’s unions and, at times, quite vindictive personal comments, I say to Mr Mallard, this lady rolled out national standards. On Monday morning of this week my daughter brought home her second national standards report together with a very clear document. For the first time in my life—and I am not a teacher—I truly understood what my daughter should be trying to achieve at her age. I say publicly that Minister Tolley has done a great job; well done to her. It is fantastic to have her as a part of this team over here.</p>
        <p class="a">National members are not happy with where the economy is, right now, and acknowledge that we have more work to do. However, the release yesterday of the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update and the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research report put us in a good space. The forecast is GDP growth of 2.1 percent now, rising to 3.5 percent. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] Opposition members do not like this one: the unemployment rate will fall steadily to 5.1 percent by 2013. Members on that side of the House wish it would go up. There will be accelerating wage growth to about 3 percent in 2012, comfortably ahead of inflation. It is excellent.</p>
        <p class="a">Labour this year, on the other hand, was in a terrible space, which was epitomised by Phil Goff’s speech at Chapman Tripp. Not only did our “Politician of the Year”, Chris Carter, continue his crusade to undermine Phil Goff but we finished the year really unsure whether the finance spokesman for Labour is David Cunliffe or David Caygill. We also now know that Phil is not particularly confident about his future, from when he said that at least he did not say he would be leader of the next Labour Government. We know that Labour is totally bereft of new ideas. Even its speech-writers had to borrow themes from speeches overseas. What is more, the only idea of any real merit in that speech—clamping down on taxpayers who rort the system—is one that Labour did a complete flip-flop on within just 3 short days by opposing, in the extreme, Peter Dunne’s Supplementary Order Paper that was specifically designed to do that.</p>
        <p class="a">This morning Mr Goff was asked what his highlights were for the year on Pippa Wetzell’s show. He answered by saying that the soccer and rugby were the highlights. Pippa pressed on: “No, Phil, I meant your political highlights.” “Oh,” said Phil, “Well, that would be Kris Faafoi’s maiden speech.” Without meaning to criticise Kris, whom I am sure all members would agree made a pretty good maiden speech, for that to be the highlight of the entire Labour year makes one wonder.</p>
        <p class="a">On that note, I wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy and safe New Year. Thank you.</p>

          <strong>Hon TREVOR MALLARD (Labour—Hutt South)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> I think the highlight of that speech made by the senior Government whip, Chris Tremain, was the fact that he moved on from thanking Pansy Wong to congratulating Anne Tolley, and I think that is probably about it.</p>
        <p class="a">I echo the comments made about the staff. I think Rodney Hide went through the list very well. I am not proposing to repeat it, but I endorse his comments about the people who work here. I thank you, Mr Speaker. I think you have mainly treated me fairly. I think the only injustice I felt was at the time you tossed me out for Chris Carter’s comment. I was certainly relieved when he got shifted down the benches. I do not think our voices are very similar, Mr Speaker, but you clearly could not differentiate on that occasion.</p>
        <p class="a">There have been some disasters. I endorse the comments Phil Goff made about the importance of following up promises with action. I will read a text I received 12 minutes ago. It said: “Just chatting to lady at dog park with fat Golden Labrador. Her insurance company told her over $100,000 when they assessed. She has a big two-storey house. Piles are stuffed, roof is stuffed, garage needs replacing, and EQC said $22,000. She had structural engineers around there today, and the house has twisted around three chimneys, and they say it must be rebuilt.” Stories like that are coming in from all over Christchurch.</p>
        <p class="a">People are very distressed, and the Minister in charge of Earthquake Commission has to get that agency’s act together, especially with regard to the people on the phone lines, because the systems are not working and that has resulted in a very poor Christmas. One does not get that sort of text unless one is involved in, and knows of, other cases, as I do.</p>
        <p class="a">I want to make a comment on Pike River. Kate Wilkinson, the Minister of Labour, was here earlier. I do not want to refer to her absence, but I am sure that she will be asking herself—as I am; and as other Ministers who have been in charge of reviews of mining safety are asking themselves—whether anything else could have been done and whether it would have made a difference. We will wait, obviously, for the inquiries and the explanations as to what actually happened before we can go into those questions, but I think all of us who have worked in that area have felt some distress and done some personal questioning.</p>
        <p class="a">I endorse the comments that Phil Goff made about the importance of retrieving the remains from the Pike River mine, but it is also important that people are paid their entire wage packages, and that people, both living and dead, get the bonuses they have earned and to which they are entitled. It is basic decency, and, in my view, it is incumbent on the Government to make sure the system works to ensure that happens, not withstanding our rules regarding receivership. It is important and it would be a sign of a decent society.</p>
        <p class="a">I will follow Chris Tremain’s theme in relation to Pansy Wong. She jumped before the inevitable firing occurred. She will run, but the issue will not go away. It is something that New Zealanders will want to find out more about, and will find out more about, because New Zealanders do not like anything that looks like corruption in our system. In my opinion, this case, as it unfolds, will look like that, and it is not acceptable.</p>
        <p class="a">I will move on to addressing Mr Brownlee. We have good-natured banter across the House on occasions. I congratulate him on his masterful handling of the House over the last week or so. I felt relatively good being in the House with six of my colleagues at 9.45 p.m. on Saturday night, while the National members had a voting strength of 58, and then we were so busy that we got to 8 p.m. on Tuesday and there was nothing to do. If that is an indication of the approach and focus on detail that will continue on behalf of
 National next year, then I welcome it and I thank Mr Brownlee for it. I think we will give him the title “House Manager Supreme”.</p>
        <a name="page_16488"></a>
        <p class="a">I have been searching for something all this year; it is called the plan. I want to know where the plan is. We are told that it has six points. In fact, we were told what they were at one stage. I cannot remember them. [<em>Interruption</em><strong></strong>] Oh, there were six areas. I will comment on one aspect. It is the major part of the plan—it is one I am interested in and care a lot about—and it is the cycleway, which will create jobs.</p>
        <p class="a">I am getting slightly sick of the Prime Minister opening cycleways that I rode on 5 years ago. The idea is that the Prime Minister spreads a bit of gravel on a track and it is called a new cycleway, and he opens it. I must say to Kevin Hague that he looks a bit of tit as he rides cycleways that many people have ridden on long before. The Greens should be embarrassed to be associated with the pretend new cycleways. There will be some new cycleways, and that is really good. I also want to say that a concrete highway from Cambridge to Karapiro is not a cycleway. It is a bit of road, and people need to know that. It is certainly not a step change in the economy.</p>
        <p class="a">I have been looking for something else. I have been looking for the statistics that tell us we are closing the wage gap with Australia. First, I looked at the statistics that we have generally used—the ones that our library gives us from Statistics New Zealand and its Australian equivalent. They have always shown that the gap has been widening. The Prime Minister gave us a new set of statistics. I think it is fair to say that they were heavily massaged. It was a “most improbable approach to statistics” as someone said. But even the Prime Minister’s massaged statistics now show us that the gap is getting bigger. That is why so many Kiwis—all of us know of individuals; friends, family, and people who live in our constituencies—are going to Australia. They are going because they have jobs, and those jobs pay more, and their standard of living will be higher, and will get higher still.</p>
        <p class="a">I will finish with a thought, and I think it will be a theme as we go forward. I thank a member of the National Government for suggesting that it be the Labour Party theme. It is a question, and it is a question that we will ask Kiwis time and time again: “Are you better off now than you were 2 years ago?”. Next year Labour will ask: “Are you better off now than you were 3 years ago when National was elected?”. Some people are. Some people who are in the top 10 percent of the income brackets are certainly better off than they were. But most Kiwis, when they are asked whether they are better off, will be honest and say no. That is why they will say: “We’re going to wave, John, while you smile.”</p>

          <strong>CATHERINE DELAHUNTY (Green)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> First I would like to pay respect to the courteous, patient, supportive, informative, and amazing people in this institution—not us, but the security staff who stand up literally hour after hour to look after our safety and our visitors’ needs; the messengers who juggle the dead trees from office to office so we can do our work; the kitchen crew at Bellamy’s, Copperfields, and Olivers, and the room service staff. They are all hard-working and polite to us. Much respect also to the cleaners who make the spaces decent and liveable for us. They are people we never actually see, but they clean up around our chaos. To all of the Clerk’s office, the library and select committee staff, Mr Speaker, the Parliamentary Service team, all our own staff, and even the Bycroft’s biscuit tin—thank you for the great impartial service and support all year.</p>
        <p class="a">I wish I could say that we MPs have been as polite and supportive as those other teams, but through #Housewatch tweeting, I have been monitoring the levels of personal abuse, and it has been a curious spectacle. As standards and league tables are the fashion, I will rank the parties. Members might be surprised who has been particularly and audibly personally abusive.</p>
        <a name="page_16489"></a>
        <p class="a">From a party point of view, the big disappointment of the year was the ACT Party, which was ranking well. However, when David Garrett left, its ranking collapsed into an occasional courteous and policy-focused interjection, apart from some strange, loud groans from Sir Roger Douglas when he was goaded beyond bearing by dreadful communist, collective, planet-loving speeches from people like me.</p>
        <p class="a">The Māori Party, Peter Dunne, Jim Anderton, and the Greens have generally behaved with exquisite decorum, despite considerable provocation. Hone Harawira did accuse someone of being very boring, but there was more than a grain of truth in that one. At least large numbers of members are trying to work on their te reo, and their pronunciation, so as to respect our first national language.</p>
        <p class="a">However, the two monolithic parties have been locked in their co-dependent ritualistic abuse, which is to be maintained at all costs. It is almost like watching one of those terrible marriages where the pair insists on living together but despise each other for using identical tactics in an endless effort to prove that they are different. Outstanding contributors to the level of personal abuse have been the Labour and National front-benchers. I cannot always hear them, but the Speaker’s face often says it all. But there have been some standout personal efforts from the National Party backbenches. Paul Quinn has overcome a mortal shyness this year and come out of his shell, and we are hoping he may find his way back into it. Chris Finlayson has matched Mr Quinn, only with words containing far more syllables.</p>
        <p class="a">My absolute favourite speech of last year was the
 <em>Brokeback Mountain</em><strong></strong>, wistful
 <em>Romeo and Juliet</em><strong></strong> romance between Gerry Brownlee and David Parker. That was not abuse; those comments were actually funny, as opposed to nasty, snide, patronising, or petty.</p>
        <p class="a">Also memorable was Todd McClay’s attack on Carmel Sepuloni for opposing union-bashing laws while wearing a “mock hyena print scarf”. Imagine what the Greens would say if it had been a real hyena! Imagine the shock across the nation if hyena-like howling and abuse disappeared from this House.</p>
        <p class="a">I live in hope that our behaviour will mature. The public would love it, and the children in the gallery would respect it. But in the meantime I will keep tweeting. It is a cheap form of therapy. In the spirit of the season, I wish all the members in the House the better therapy of rest, sunshine, and being with people that we love.</p>
        <p class="a">It has been tough for many people in 2010, and heartbreaking for others. We cannot pretend that Godzone is at peace with itself. However, the Green Party is in good heart to contest an election next year, under MMP, which has brought a degree of sanity and representation to the Parliament.</p>
        <p class="a">In the meantime we wish everyone here the best for a very green Christmas and a happy New Year.</p>

          <strong>Hon JOHN BOSCAWEN (Deputy Leader—ACT)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> It is a privilege to take a call in the adjournment debate as the deputy leader of the ACT Party. It is a very special time of year. It is a chance for us to spend valuable time with our friends and family over Christmas, and to take a break from Parliament.</p>
        <p class="a">The past year has been one of highs and lows. Although the Government passed ACT’s “three strikes” policy into law to help protect all New Zealanders, it also implemented the emissions trading scheme, much to ACT’s disappointment. ACT opposes the emissions trading scheme as it is a costly, bureaucratic mess of a policy that is damaging our country and has unnecessarily increased the prices of electricity and petrol, and, worse still, paid massive subsidies to foresters.</p>
        <p class="a">We are out of line with, and in front of, our major trading partners. We have jumped the gun and are still running, and no one is following. As ACT suggested, a simple low-rate carbon tax was by far and away the best option as our contribution to a genuinely
 global effort while we waited to see the science develop and to see whether the rest of the world changed its mind.</p>
        <a name="page_16490"></a>
        <p class="a">ACT also opposed the anti-smacking law, which made criminals out of good parents, and, worse still, created uncertainty.</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Catherine Delahunty</strong>: It didn’t.</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>Hon JOHN BOSCAWEN</strong>: Yes, it did.</p>
        <p class="a">The way the law purports to work is to require the police to act with discretion rather than apply the letter of the law. That is a disgraceful way to make and apply law. ACT proposed a better alternative, which would have made it clear where the boundaries are and would have protected good parents while punishing only the bad. It is a pity that that alternative did not see support from other parties in this House.</p>
        <p class="a">This year has also seen, once more, the foreshore and seabed issue come before the House. ACT is the only party that has maintained a consistent view on this issue, which is, simply, that iwi and hapū deserve the right to have their claims heard in open court. That is why we opposed the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004, and it is why we do not support the Government’s Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Bill.</p>
        <p class="a">Next year, no doubt, will be equally busy, and I hope that every member of this House takes the coming break as an opportunity to get some rest in 2011. Today I would like to extend my thanks and best wishes to a number of people, beginning with my esteemed colleagues, Rodney Hide, leader of the ACT Party; Hilary Calvert, Sir Roger Douglas, and Heather Roy.</p>
        <p class="a">I thank also the staff at the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, who have been invaluable at assisting me in coming to grips with consumer affairs portfolio. I am very grateful for the hard work of my office staff, and I hope they all have a peaceful Christmas and a well-earned break. I wish the same for my staff in Auckland.</p>
        <p class="a">Thanks must also go to the Speaker, the Speaker’s office, the Office of the Clerk, the Serjeant-at-Arms, the messengers, the Chamber officials, security, VIP Transport Service, the travel office, Epicure Catering staff, the Parliamentary Counsel Office, and the Parliamentary Library staff.</p>
        <p class="a">I also wish a merry Christmas to ACT’s support partners: the Māori Party and Peter Dunne’s United Future. We three may not necessarily agree on everything, but we have a positive relationship that transcends our differences. To my parliamentary colleagues in Opposition, ACT extends its best wishes for a merry Christmas and a safe holiday break. Thank you.</p>

          <strong>RAHUI KATENE (Māori Party—Te Tai Tonga)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> I am very pleased to stand and speak in this adjournment debate. Mr Speaker, firstly, I endorse the comments of other members in thanking you for the accomplished way in which you have managed this House over the past year. It has not been an easy year, particularly so in my electorate of Te Tai Tonga.</p>
        <p class="a">I want to single out Gerry Brownlee for the impressive way in which he has led the response to two extraordinary events this year. In doing so, I must also acknowledge my fellow MPs of the West Coast and Canterbury regions right across this House. Together we have been profoundly moved by the heart-wrenching grief of a small close-knit community bereft of 29 of its members. We fielded the crisis calls as families reeled from the consequences of the mine receivership and despaired at the shrinking opportunities they feared for the Grey District economy. We have listened to the frustrations of homeowners as they learnt of the prolonged time frames required for land to be strengthened before the job of reconstruction can even begin. We have sought help for those people facing hardship as a result of the Canterbury earthquake, and we will continue to do so.</p>
        <a name="page_16491"></a>
        <p class="a">Of course we know that hardship is not just specific to Te Tai Tonga. In just these last few days, for example, we have felt for the whānau associated with the Carter Holt Harvey sawmill in Kawerau and the Prime Sawmills in Gisborne in the wake of announcements made there. Just 2 days ago it was devastating to hear the findings of the report from the New Zealand Child and Youth Epidemiology Service, which showed that children in low-income households, especially Māori and Pasifika children, appear to bear the brunt of the recession. A particular low point to note is the increase in the number of Māori and Pasifika children admitted to hospital for infectious and respiratory diseases since the recession began. It is hard to find any Christmas cheer in information such as this. I could add to that list, of course, the longstanding endurance of the people of Tūhoe as they await a fair hearing.</p>
        <p class="a">How do we find hope that a difference can be made, when we are all aware of the struggles and the injustices that continue to be felt? I take comfort from one of our whakatauāki, which says “Ānō ko te marama kua ngaro, kua ara anō”. It may be translated as “Just like the moon that disappears and arises again”, or perhaps a shorter way of saying it is six times down, seven times up.</p>
        <p class="a">I want to acknowledge the spirit of willingness that we have experienced in various ways this year as different relationships have been built between the Māori Party and parties across the House. These are in the main relationships built out of concern about the people—to eliminate social hazards and to focus on improving outcomes for all New Zealanders. I think of the support that Tariana Turia’s legislative advances in tobacco reform have enjoyed, and the profound impact right across the Māori Affairs Committee following the inquiry Hone Harawira initiated to investigate the impact of the tobacco industry upon Māori. I recall the interest illustrated by the Greens and Labour in the bill I promoted to remove GST off healthy food, a sharing of minds that was also evident in the Local Government and Environment Committee. We hope that such openness will also be demonstrated when Te Ururoa Flavell’s Gambling (Gambling Harm Reduction) Amendment Bill comes up, and when the cross-party action I am encouraging on addressing child poverty happens.</p>
        <p class="a">Of course there are also some strange things that happen in this place, and I have to note the unholy alliance on the Marine and Coastal (Takutai Moana) Bill forged between the Labour Party, the ACT Party, the Coastal Coalition, and the Greens—that was not one that we anticipated. In talking about the Marine and Coastal (Takutai Moana) Bill, I have to warn Mr Boscawen that when he speaks about it to please pronounce it properly, because “tuku tai” is something completely different—it has a totally different meaning. The Māori Party appreciated the strength of support for this bill expressed to us by hapū, iwi, and electorate organisations throughout the country. They told us that we have kept faith with them in seeking to repeal the 2004 Act and to restore the right of Māori to take the claims to court. Progress is incremental, but it will continue to be of utmost priority to us to honour the promise we made to our people.</p>
        <p class="a">Finally, I acknowledge the initiative taken by Dr Mapp today in signalling his decision not to stand at the 2011 election. I want to place on record that I am more than happy to help out in a ministerial capacity in defence, and in research, and science, and technology should the Government desire it, because that is the way of the Māori Party. We are not only prepared to step up to the plate in every regard, but we do so in the knowledge that every issue is a Māori issue—a Māori Party issue—and every day is an opportunity to improve outcomes for all our people. That is why we love coming to work each day. Our best wishes are sent right across the House for a happy Christmas, and may all members enjoy the blessings of being with family at this special time of year.</p>

          <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Honourable members, I thank you all for your kind comments, especially the kind wishes some of you have expressed to my wife, Alexandra. I also thank members for the expressions of thanks from all around the House to the hundreds of people who make this place operate.</p>
        <p class="a">I first thank my presiding officers’ team. The Deputy Speaker, Lindsay Tisch, does extraordinary hours in the Chair and does a remarkable job of organising the team, and I want him to know how much I appreciate that. The Assistant Speakers, the Hon Rick Barker and Eric Roy, do a great job in maintaining the kind of style I have tried to bring to the role of the Speakership. I really appreciate their commitment, as well.</p>
        <p class="a">I acknowledge the work of the Leader of the House, the Hon Gerry Brownlee, the shadow Leader of the House, the Hon Darren Hughes, and the whips from all around the House. Many of those people are members of the Business Committee, and I really appreciate the constructive approach they bring to that committee, as well as to the work of the Standing Orders Committee—a number of those members are also on the Standing Orders Committee. In that light, can I acknowledge the Hon Trevor Mallard. Some people may have noticed the odd terse exchange—</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Hon Member</strong>: Really?</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: —very occasionally—which the member himself referred to in his contribution this afternoon. I acknowledge that the Hon Trevor Mallard brings a wealth of experience and a very constructive approach to both the Business Committee and the Standing Orders Committee. I want to acknowledge that because I am sure that not many members of the public would be aware of that very valued contribution.</p>
        <p class="a">I thank all members for the courtesy they extend me as Speaker. I know that it is impossible to get everything right. At times I apologise when I do not get things right, but you extend extraordinary courtesy to me, from the Prime Minister on down. To tell the Prime Minister at times that he is being a bit naughty and needs to sit down is sometimes quite daunting. I am always very gratified by the way that the Prime Minister, Ministers, and all members of the House treat me with extraordinary courtesy. I am very grateful for that.</p>
        <p class="a">I thank the Clerk of the House. Mary Harris is an extraordinarily competent—extraordinarily competent—Clerk. We are so lucky to be served by her. I mention also her executive assistant, Andie, who is just a gem. I think the two are a formidable team. I thank the staff of the whole of the Clerk’s Office, from the Deputy Clerk right down. So many of them keep this House operating, at times in quite challenging circumstances. I thank the select committee clerks, and the whole team: the Parliamentary Counsel Office, the Bills Office, the Hansard team, the Parliamentary Library staff, our loyal Chamber and gallery officers, our interpreters, the messengers, the security staff, the building maintenance and cleaning staff, our reception and visitors team—they all play a vital role in how this place operates. I thank our sound, radio, and television technicians, who are working right at this moment to bring our telecasts and broadcasts to the public. We have had a bit of a challenging year this year with the sound system in this place, but I think we have overcome most of those problems. I thank the travel office, which has to put up with our bookings changing up to five times for every trip we make. I thank the Bellamy’s staff, and the behind the scenes team of Geoff Thorn and his Parliamentary Service staff, and I include there our electorate office staff, who work so hard to support us. Last but not least, I thank our remarkable kaumātua, Rose White Tahupārae, who does her job with extraordinary dignity and actually great organisational skills as well.</p>
        <p class="a">I thank my Serjeant-at-Arms, Brent Smith, and my own office staff: Roland, on my right here, Trish, and Beryl, who now is in her 25th year of working with me—a quarter of a century. She started in this place ahead of me. She worked in the office of one of
 Sir Robert Muldoon’s Ministers before I arrived in this place, so she has an extraordinary trove of knowledge. Those of you who interact with my office will know how valuable she is. I thank my team, because we continue to run the office on just 50 percent of the cost of the office when I arrived in that place.</p>

        <p class="a">To 11 o’clock this morning you people had worked in this place—the House had sat—for 595 hours and 58 minutes. That is 30 hours more than last year. A total of 127 bills received the Royal assent, and 12 of them are waiting for the Royal assent at the moment, which is double last year’s 66 in total. Written questions lodged have doubled from 19,822 to 39,817. I say to all members that I think you do deserve a break.</p>
        <p class="a">So too does the press gallery. I acknowledge that its members have also worked hard. I am sure all members of this House would acknowledge that they do not always see eye to eye with everything the press gallery does, but its members are committed to what they do and they work very hard.</p>
        <p class="a">All I would say is that it is at times very easy to criticise our Parliament, but as someone who has been to many Parliaments in many supposedly democratic places around the world I know that this place has many strengths, and to me it is a shame to endlessly criticise it.</p>
        <p class="a">As we depart to enjoy some relaxation this Christmas, I am sure that we will all want to remember the families of the Pike River miners so tragically killed just a few short weeks ago. Christmas for those families will not be the same. Such a family-focused time will reinforce their awful loss. Our thoughts and prayers will be with them this Christmas. Colleagues, go forth and do enjoy yourselves. Go well and I look forward to seeing you all next year.</p>
