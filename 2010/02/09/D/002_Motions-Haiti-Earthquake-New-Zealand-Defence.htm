            <strong>Hon JOHN KEY (Prime Minister)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I seek leave to move a motion without notice relating to the recent disaster in Haiti.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Is there any objection to that course of action being followed? There is no objection.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon JOHN KEY</strong>: I move,
 <em>That this House express its deepest sympathy and condolences to the people and the Government of Haiti, who suffered the devastating earthquake on 12 January 2010 that has resulted in catastrophic loss of life and a massive humanitarian disaster.
 </em><strong></strong></p>
          <p class="a">On 12 January Haiti was hit by a devastating earthquake that killed an estimated 200,000 people and left more than 1 million people homeless. New Zealand’s deepest condolences go to the Government and the people of Haiti as they struggle with the enormous losses and damage caused by this disaster. Among the casualties, a New Zealand woman working at the United Nations in Haiti lost her husband and two of her daughters. Our heartfelt sympathy goes to Emily Sanson-Rejouis and her family for their loss. We offer our condolences, too, to the families of the many United Nations staff members and other international workers who were killed in the disaster.</p>
          <p class="a">In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake the New Zealand Government announced it would make an initial contribution of $1 million to international relief efforts. As the enormity of the disaster began to emerge over the following day New Zealand pledged a further $1 million. These funds have been channelled through the World Food Programme, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and New Zealand non-governmental organisations and their affiliates in Haiti. In addition, the New Zealand public has once again reacted generously to the international disaster, donating in excess of $2 million to the New Zealand Red Cross Society and non-governmental organisation appeals. The international response to the humanitarian crisis in Haiti has been significant, with countries collectively pledging over US$1 billion to the United Nations flash appeal and broader relief efforts.</p>
          <p class="a">New Zealand continues to monitor closely the situation in Haiti, and the Government is ready to look at making a further contribution to recovery and reconstruction efforts as a clearer picture emerges of Haiti’s long-term needs.</p>

            <strong>Hon PHIL GOFF (Leader of the Opposition)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> All of us in the House today would want to express our heartfelt sympathy with, and our condolences to, the people of Haiti for the tragedy that they suffered on 12 January this year. We can barely imagine the ordeal that those people went through. An estimated 200,000 people were killed, 300,000 were injured, and a quarter of a million homes were destroyed. People today are still suffering there from inadequacy of food, of shelter, and of sanitation, and a lack of security, a lack of medical treatment, and a lack of clean water.</p>
          <a name="page_8642"></a>
          <p class="a">I think all of us felt the despair and the helplessness as we heard on morning radio of the plight of New Zealander Emily Sanson-Rejouis, who searched desperately for her three young children and her husband, digging with her bare hands because there was nobody there who could help her in that task. Very fortunately, she was able to recover her baby, Alyahna, but her two daughters, who had attended preschool in Nelson in New Zealand, Zenzie and Kofie-Jade, aged just 3 and 5, perished, along with her husband, Emmanuel.</p>
          <p class="a">I am glad that New Zealand has been able to help in a small way—$2 million from the Government, and another $2 million given to aid agencies through the generosity of New Zealanders. But I wish we could have done more immediately, and perhaps the time has come for New Zealand to have its own ready-reaction force, which could go in there immediately, help with search and rescue, and help with the urgent needs of reconstruction. Having a group of that nature gaining experience by helping others internationally would be of huge assistance if we suffered a disaster of that nature in New Zealand.</p>
          <p class="a">I wish the people of Haiti well as they struggle to recover, and I offer to support the Government in any further assistance that may be necessary to help those unfortunate people through their ordeal.</p>

            <strong>Dr KENNEDY GRAHAM (Green)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> The Green Party joins with others in expressing its deep condolences to the people of Haiti in their time of tragedy and to the family of our own New Zealand compatriot. This proud nation, the first of its kind to gain independence in the Americas over two centuries ago, has seen more than its share of disaster. As early as 1770 its capital, Port au Prince, was devastated by an earthquake, and that happened again in 1842. Haiti has been ravaged repeatedly by hurricanes and floods, but nothing over the years compares with the devastation of the kind that visited the country 4 weeks ago.</p>
          <p class="a">Those of us in our own far-off islands find such numbers difficult to comprehend. We have had tragedies of our own, though nothing comparable in scale. Yet in our own geologically young country, with its restless turbulence, both volcanic and seismic, we share in the very human feeling of a common vulnerability. So we extend our heartfelt sympathy to all those who have lost loved ones and are struggling to survive and even to comprehend.</p>
          <p class="a">Having visited Port au Prince on a mission some years ago with Parliamentarians for Global Action, and having held meetings in the presidential palace and with MPs in the national assembly, I harbour a special feeling of personal sorrow for what has occurred and for those who may have been tragically affected.</p>
          <p class="a">It is pleasing to know, however, that New Zealanders have responded to the disaster with characteristic generosity. The Government has provided $2 million, and the public has given almost $2.5 million. New Zealanders have responded by opening their hearts and their wallets, giving generously through various relief organisations. We are doing what we can to help our fellow humans on the other side of the planet, and we shall continue to do so. Thank you.</p>

            <strong>Hon RODNEY HIDE (Leader—ACT)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> It is a great privilege to rise on behalf of the ACT Party to reflect in this Parliament the feelings and the empathy of the people of New Zealand for this distant nation in its time of great tragedy. It was amazing for Kiwis to see what befell Haiti—the damage, the devastation, and the despair—and I know that I speak on behalf of all New Zealanders when I say that the people of this distant nation have been constantly in all our thoughts and all our prayers as the modern age brings this distant island nation, which many of us may not even have heard of, into our living rooms each night. Such is the human condition that we have felt for their plight. Is it not an amazing thing in this great nation that Kiwis have opened not just
 their hearts but also, as Mr Kennedy Graham said, their wallets for those people? Thank you.</p>

            <strong>Hon TARIANA TURIA (Co-Leader—Māori Party)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Tēnā tātou katoa. The Māori Party stands to express our deepest sympathies with those affected by the utter tragedy that unfolded in Port-au-Prince less than a month ago. It has been a catastrophe on such a scale that it is really hard to comprehend. The ramifications of that day have been widespread, with a shortage of food supplies; medical centres straining to cope; communication systems in disarray; air, land, and sea transport facilities, hospitals, and electrical networks damaged beyond use; and emergency relief accommodation and sanitation all in a state of crisis.</p>
          <p class="a">Haiti is known as the poorest nation in the western hemisphere. It is a nation in which inadequate infrastructure had already left its people in a vulnerable state. In the midst of such chaos, three things have stood out. The first is the collaboration between former United States Presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush and the current President, Barack Obama. We hope that those three men will invest in a future for Haiti to assist long-term recovery and to confront the unspeakable devastation.</p>
          <p class="a">Secondly, there is the remarkable story of human resilience as each survivor was uncovered from the rubble. Like a delicate lotus flower emerging from the swamp, each survivor has shown us the strength of the human spirit in its full magnificence. Ultimately, that fight to live—that sheer will to endure—will be a foundation for their future.</p>
          <p class="a">Finally, I pay my tributes to the generosity of the New Zealand heart to support that little nation so far away. Kia ora.</p>

            <strong>Hon JIM ANDERTON (Leader—Progressive)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Our heartfelt condolences go to the people of Haiti from this House today. Over the Christmas - New Year holiday period, we looked on in shock and horror as that fragile and poverty-stricken country crumbled in a devastating earthquake. It seems so unfair that one of the poorest countries in the world should fall victim to a natural disaster of that magnitude. Port-au-Prince is an earthquake-prone capital, just like Wellington, but we have spent hundreds of millions of dollars earthquake-proofing our civic buildings. Haitian buildings look less stable than matchbox houses.</p>
          <p class="a">So why was there no solid infrastructure in Haiti, like there is in New Zealand? The simple answer is that Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world and New Zealand is not. The real tragedy for Haiti is that before the earthquake hit, the Government of René Préval had committed itself to a huge programme of development. The international community, led by former US President Bill Clinton, had got behind Haiti. A huge programme was about to begin. Finally, the country was on the right road for growth after years of dictatorship and corrupt government. Then the earthquake hit.</p>
          <p class="a">Today the international community, including New Zealand, must take this opportunity to pick up that action plan again. We must listen to the people of Haiti. It is my heartfelt hope that the Government will represent New Zealand and decide to play a role in the recovery phase, no matter how small our part, and I am sure the whole House will join in supporting the Government in that endeavour. We can help to decide whether Haiti will have a future of growth or will return to abject poverty. The decisions the international community makes today really do matter.</p>
          <p class="a">I hope that New Zealand will be a strong voice in the international community for jobs, because what the Haitian people need, after the immediate relief effort is done, are jobs that will give them income. When the international community, non-governmental organisations, and Governments move in to help rebuild roads, power stations, and buildings, I hope they will use Haitian labour. Give the people the jobs they need! By all means, bring in skilled labour that Haiti does not have, but Haiti does not need just
 Doctors Without Borders; it needs architects, engineers, and accountants. Use the people of Haiti to build, and give them a living. New Zealand will do much more for the people of Haiti if we advocate this approach to development right from the beginning.</p>
          <a name="page_8644"></a>
          <p class="a">This has been an unimaginable tragedy for Haiti. The rebuilding of that country must now be seen as an opportunity for the international community, including New Zealand, and for a country and a people who deserve a better future.</p>

            <strong>Hon PETER DUNNE (Leader—United Future)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> On behalf of United Future I share in the sentiments that others have expressed and support the motion that the Prime Minister has moved regarding the appalling situation that struck the country of Haiti in early January. I guess it is one of the sad realities of today’s world that we are not unused to seeing tragedy unfold on our television screens. We are not unused to seeing pictures of carnage and destruction. But when those first pictures came through from Port-au-Prince and we saw that buildings had been not just damaged but literally razed to the ground, that no infrastructure was in place, and that there was not even the capacity, as graphically illustrated by the case of the New Zealand woman searching for her family, to conduct proper searches, it struck home that this devastation went far beyond the norm that we have become so used to seeing in far-off parts of the world.</p>
          <p class="a">The enormity of the tragedy, which others have reflected on, has some lessons for us as a small country, as well. We are prone to earthquakes, in this city in particular. There will be a time when we may well face similar disruption. The lessons that arise from Haiti are that in such circumstances the international community needs to pull together to make recovery possible. These things are often beyond a nation itself. I think that New Zealand’s response to date has been good and proper. It needs to continue not just in the interests of the well-being of the people of Haiti, and not just in the interests of that nation’s reconstruction, but also in the interests of our commitment to being part of a connected world that bears its share of responsibility in these situations, even if for no other reason than that the time may well come when we expect others to do likewise in respect of our country.</p>
          <p class="a">So it is appropriate for this Parliament to support this motion today. It is appropriate to express our sympathy but also our hope for the people of Haiti. It is also appropriate for our country to play its part in the recovery.</p>

        <p class="Interjection">

        <p class="a">Of behalf of this House, I offer my sincere sympathy to the colleagues, friends, and especially the family of Squadron Leader Cree. After 14 years in the Air Force Nick Cree had achieved impressive career highlights. He was hard-working, meticulous, and talented, gaining the East Timor Medal in May 2001, the New Zealand Operational Service Medal in 2002, the New Zealand General Service Medal for his work in the Solomon Islands in 2004, and another New Zealand General Service Medal for his role in Timor-Leste in November 2007. He also served a stint in Singapore.</p>
        <a name="page_8645"></a>
        <p class="a">At the time of his death Squadron Leader Cree was a flight commander and an A category instructor at Ōhākea, a role for which he showed considerable talent. He instructed students on fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, in which he did most of his flying. He had been flying with the Red Checkers, the Royal New Zealand Air Force’s six-person elite aerobatic demonstration team, and was practising in one of its air trainers when he was tragically killed.</p>
        <p class="a">Squadron Leader Cree was just 32. He leaves behind his wife, Sarah, his baby son, Jackson, and many more family and friends. Colleagues have said that Squadron Leader Cree was a consummate professional who had a passion for flying. His family have described a man who was proud of his family and had packed a lot into his life.</p>
        <p class="a">This tragedy sadly serves to remind us that the New Zealand Defence Force members, both in New Zealand and overseas, regularly put their lives at risk. The Royal New Zealand Air Force’s safety record is excellent but there are always dangers when flying, and regrettably they can claim the lives of even the very best of our pilots.</p>

          <strong>Hon PHIL GOFF (Leader of the Opposition)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> On behalf of the New Zealand Labour Party I join with everyone else in this House in extending our condolences to Squadron Leader Nick Cree’s wife, Sarah, his young son, Jackson, his wider family and friends, and his colleagues in the New Zealand Defence Force. His tragic death is a huge loss, most particularly, of course, to his family—a young wife has lost her husband and a child has lost his father—but also to his Defence Force colleagues, amongst whom he was well respected and well liked.</p>
        <p class="a">Squadron Leader Cree was one of the best pilots of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. He was a member of the famed Red Checkers team, and he was an A category flying instructor. He had served New Zealand in operational deployments—in fact, in three, two in Timor-Leste and one in the Solomon Islands. He was only 32 years old, but he had achieved a lot in that time. As his younger brother said, he gave everything 100 percent. He had a passion for flying, he had a passion for sport, and in fact he had completed two New Zealand Ironman competitions.</p>
        <p class="a">His death is a reminder to all of us that, daily, members of the New Zealand Defence Force, at home and abroad, put their lives at risk in the nature of the work that they do on behalf of their country. Together with his family and friends, we mourn his loss.</p>

          <strong>METIRIA TUREI (Co-Leader—Green)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> The Green Party also would like to send to Squadron Leader Nicholas Cree’s whānau, his friends, and his colleagues our sincerest aroha for their loss. Nicholas Cree served, as has been said, in Timor-Leste, in Singapore, and in the Solomons as part of a peacekeeping mission, and we acknowledge his efforts in promoting peace in the Pacific and around the world. He was just a young man, and was described by his friends as “a bloody good guy”. He was a top instructor, and, I am sure, an inspiration to all of his students and those who worked with him. We would also like to acknowledge Jason Dellow for his heroic efforts in attempting a rescue and in the recovery, and for all of his work. The Royal New Zealand Air Force motto, I understand, is “Through adversity to the stars”, and the Green Party sincerely hopes that Squadron Leader Nicholas Cree rests peacefully among them. Kia ora.</p>

          <strong>Hon HEATHER ROY (Deputy Leader—ACT)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> I rise on behalf of the ACT Party to mark the passing of Royal New Zealand Air Force pilot Squadron Leader Nicholas Cree, who was tragically killed on 14 January at Ōhākea air force base while practising aerial display manoeuvres. Nick Cree was a member of the Royal New Zealand Air Force acrobatic team, the Red Checkers, and was “Checkers 5”. Only our very best pilots are chosen to fly with the Red Checkers.</p>
        <p class="a">One of the hardest things, I think, for Ministers of Defence is to farewell, alongside Defence Force personnel and families, our fit young military people who have tragically had their lives cut short in the course of their service to New Zealand. On 19 January
 Ministers Mapp, Power, and I attended the funeral service of Squadron Leader Cree at Ōhākea. We heard of a young man in his prime, a son, a brother, a husband, and a father, who was passionate about everything he did—not just about his love of flying and his career with the air force but about his family, and in particular he took great pride in twice finishing the physically punishing Ironman competition.</p>
        <a name="page_8646"></a>
        <p class="a">As we have heard from others, Squadron Leader Cree served his country for 14 years. During that time he served with dedication and professionalism both at home and abroad, flying on deployment in the Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste where he commanded a detachment of helicopters. He also served on exchange with the Singaporean air force.</p>
        <p class="a">Possessed of an excellent flying record and a real love of flying, Squadron Leader Cree was one of the Royal New Zealand Air Force’s most talented and experienced flying instructors. He served as a flight commander at the Central Flying School and was an A category instructor, instructing students on both rotary and fixed-wing aircraft.</p>
        <p class="a">There is always an element of danger with flying, and Squadron Leader Cree’s passing is a reminder of the dangers faced every day by New Zealand Defence Force personnel. It is a reminder that our servicemen and women put their lives on the line both on deployment and when serving their country when exercising and training at home. It is also a reminder that “they also serve, who stay at home and wait”. Families serve and bear the brunt of the commitment and dedication of their loved ones serving in our defence forces.</p>
        <p class="a">Squadron Leader Nick Cree will be sorely missed by his friends and colleagues at Ōhākea and more widely in the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and our thoughts are with his family and loved ones at this time of loss.</p>

          <em>There is a saying in the Māori world about how “the eyes overflow with tears” when a life is lost in tragic circumstances. My esteemed colleagues, this is why I rise to bid farewell to this warrior from within the air force, whose name is Nick Cree. The Māori Party rises to endorse the tributes expressed at this painful loss to the air force, to the nation at large, and particularly his family. It was heart-rending to hear what his brother had to say about him. What a person this man was. To them he was sharp, clever, industrious, and daring. He was good at everything he did, no matter what it was.

          <em>To my knowledge, this man’s aerial moves came to bear while he was at Ōhākea. He did a tour of duty in the Solomons, East Timor, and Singapore. It is sad indeed that he is gone. He was talented in everything he did, but his wife, Sarah, is widowed now, and his child of just 4 months is left bereft and without a father.

          <em>So as we make tributes of farewell, thoughts must go to those of the armed forces who fell in the line of duty, and for what purpose? It was for the good of New Zealand at large, be it favourable or not. Acknowledge them. Acknowledge the one who became a father for his child, a husband to his wife, a close relative to his elder and younger siblings, his sisters, and a comrade in arms to those in the armed forces. At the end of it all, release him to the graveyard of his forebears, where he will rest and slumber.

It is right that we weep for them, but in doing so spare a thought as well for those at present overseas in the armed forces to celebrate the stories adorning the walls of the House. Seek that they return home safely and well, so that we can honour them as warriors of New Zealand. Greetings to you, Mr Speaker, as you bond and become united with the House.

          <strong>Hon PETER DUNNE (Leader—United Future)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> I join with other members in expressing sympathy to the Royal New Zealand Air Force and to the wife and family of Squadron Leader Cree on his recent tragic death. This was a man who, by all accounts, was one of the outstanding up-and-coming members of our Defence Force, a pilot beyond peer, and well regarded by his colleagues. He had an extraordinary range of achievements for a 14-year career, yet he met his end tragically, performing what was described as a routine manoeuvre. I guess that simply serves to confirm the point that has been made about the danger involved in all of these activities, and about the absolute fragility of service in this regard. On that calm morning in mid-January, no one
 could have imagined the events that were about to befall the Cree family and the wider air force community at Ōhākea. It is certainly true that they have had an impact.</p>
        <a name="page_8648"></a>
        <p class="a">I hope that the sympathy and the outpouring of support in recent times will be of some consolation to Squadron Leader Cree’s wife, Sarah, and will be a proud memory for young Jackson as he grows up knowing of his father but not having the presence of his company. I also hope that the way in which this man’s career was able to be achieved, with the support and encouragement of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, acts as an encouragement and an incentive for other young New Zealanders to come forward and offer their life to service in the way that Squadron Leader Nicholas Cree did.</p>
