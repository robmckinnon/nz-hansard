            <strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE (Minister of Transport)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I seek leave to move without notice a motion relating to the Fox Glacier aviation tragedy.</p>
          <p class="Interjection">
            <strong>Mr SPEAKER</strong>: Is there any objection to that course being followed? There is none.</p>
          <p class="ContinueSpeech">
            <strong>Hon STEVEN JOYCE</strong>: I move,
 <em>That this House note the tragic loss of nine lives on Saturday in the air accident at Fox Glacier and express its sympathy and condolences to the victims’ friends and families in New Zealand, Ireland, Australia, Germany, and England</em><strong></strong>. On Saturday afternoon, as the day unfolded in Canterbury and the full magnitude of that truly traumatic event began to become apparent, on the other side of the South Island the sun was shining on a beautiful late winter’s day and nine people set off from a small airstrip at Fox Glacier, with four visitors to this country about to enjoy the beauty of this wonderful part of our scenery via the unique experience of a tandem skydive. Tragically, our visitors and their hosts never got to enjoy that experience. Their plane crashed almost immediately after take-off, and a fire ensued. No one on board stood a chance.</p>
          <a name="page_13680"></a>
          <p class="a">So as the nation experienced the great relief of thousands of lives having been spared from a natural disaster, we also felt the great sorrow of nine lives lost in a terrible tragedy. They were Chaminda Senadhira of Queenstown, Adam Bennett of Motueka, Michael Suter of New Plymouth, Christopher McDonald of Māpua, Rodney Miller of Greymouth, Patrick Byrne of Ireland, Glenn Bourke of Australia, Annita Kirsten of Germany, and Brad Coker of England. The loss of each of them is not just untimely but unfair. For those who knew these people, this sorrow and loss will linger for a very, very long time to come. Our thoughts are with the many people who have been affected by this very tragic event.</p>
          <p class="a">I wish to express my heartfelt condolences, and those of the Government, to the families, friends, and colleagues of the five New Zealanders who died, and to those in Australia, England, Ireland, and Germany who have lost a loved one. New Zealand’s aviation and skydiving industries are tight-knit communities, and I know that they are feeling devastated by what has happened. Tributes to the victims have flowed in from aeroclubs and skydiving operators around the country. All have spoken of their respect for their lost colleagues and of the great love that those who died had for their jobs. As one person said, “There wasn’t anything else they wanted to do.” I also wish to acknowledge the tributes to the victims from overseas. Their friends and family talk of people with a love of travel and adventure, and of young people who lived life to the full. It is especially heartbreaking that their young lives were cut short, so far from home.</p>
          <p class="a">The township of Fox Glacier is a community in mourning. I understand that on Saturday night the township came together to remember their lost mates. At a local pub the victims’ favourite drinks were arranged on a pool table next to a sign that simply said “RIP, boys”. Of course, I did not personally know any of those who died, but from what I have been told I am sure that that tribute would have meant the world to them.</p>
          <p class="a">I spoke with Westland mayor Maureen Pugh this morning, and she told me what a wonderful job the emergency services have done: how straight-up yet how compassionate they had been. She told me that just about every house in the village has a view of the airstrip, and that many people witnessed the accident or its aftermath. She told me how proud she was of the way that the people of Fox Glacier stepped up, despite their own shock at what had happened. It shows what a great little village Fox Glacier is that one of the first things that people have done there is to rally together to help provide comfort to the overseas families who are mourning a terrible loss, including those who were travelling in a foreign country with their friends and partners, and who were suddenly left on their own.</p>
          <p class="a">We do not know yet what caused the plane to crash. That knowledge will come in time, but right now it is a time for reflection, commiseration, and remembrance of those who have died. Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>

            <strong>Hon DAMIEN O’CONNOR (Labour)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I rise to support the motion. On behalf of the Labour Party I express our deepest sympathy for the families of the nine people who were so tragically taken from them on Saturday.</p>
          <p class="a">Less than 12 hours after a massive earthquake on the east coast, without any loss of life, it seems almost incomprehensible that nine lives could be lost on the West Coast in the course of a normal tourism operation. On a spectacular South Westland day, in one of the most inspiring environments in the world, four enthusiastic young tourists to New Zealand were ready for an amazing adventure. This was the ninth flight of the day by a very experienced pilot, in a plane built for the job, and all four experienced jumpmasters had prepared, as they had for literally thousands of jumps before this fateful occasion. No words can describe, or compensate for, this horrific tragedy, as friends of the
 deceased waited and watched as this crash occurred right in front of them. To them we also offer our support in any way we can.</p>
          <a name="page_13681"></a>
          <p class="a">I visited the site yesterday, and I understand that my colleague Chris Auchinvole has been there as well. The people are stunned; the community is numb.</p>
          <p class="a">I can relate to these people in a number of ways. I have jumped out of a plane with Rod Miller on three occasions and can attest to his professionalism and enthusiasm. With his partner John Kerr, he built this company to be a key activity in West Coast tourism. Our sympathy goes to Rod’s wife, Robyn, and to their two sons. As a former adventure tourism operator, I can attest to the experience and professionalism of the three other jumpmasters—Adam Bennett, Michael Suter, and Christopher McDonald—who have shared their passion for skydiving with tens of thousands of thrill-seekers. Although it has always been a high-risk activity, their families and friends will be struggling to come to terms with their loss. They have our deepest sympathy. The very experienced pilot Chaminda Senadhira had a new family—a wife and a daughter—who will be in shock. We offer them our deepest sympathy and support. As a West Coaster, I can say that those people were part of a small Fox Glacier community—a community that exists with nature, with tourism, and with the risks and rewards that depend upon the professionalism of adventurers such as those who were tragically killed on Saturday.</p>
          <p class="a">We must offer also our special sympathy and support to the families of the four young tourists who lost their lives: Patrick Byrne from Ireland, Glenn Bourke from Australia, Annita Kirsten from Germany, and Brad Coker from England. They came to New Zealand for a special holiday. They cannot return to their homes to tell of their experiences and adventures. We all have a responsibility to look after those who visit us in the true spirit of manaakitanga. We cannot explain at this stage why their lives were lost, but we can give a commitment to do everything possible to prevent such terrible tragedies occurring in the future. No amount of speculation or guesswork will help. We must allow a proper investigation to conclude, and act from there.</p>
          <p class="a">We offer our deepest sympathy to the friends of those adventurous travellers and to the families of all those who were tragically killed. Our thoughts, prayers, and deepest sympathy go out to all of them. Kia kaha.</p>

            <strong>Dr RUSSEL NORMAN (Co-Leader—Green)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> The Green Party joins with other parties in this House in extending our aroha, our sympathy and love, to the friends, whānau, and colleagues of the nine who were tragically killed at Fox Glacier, a tight-knit town that has lost five of its own in one afternoon and is for ever joined in grief with four other families from around the world. With sudden and tragic loss of life, it is often hard to comprehend; we struggle to make sense of these events when so many people with so much potential are suddenly lost. We send our thoughts out to the people of Fox Glacier and acknowledge the impact that this event will have had on them. To the families and loved ones of all four tourists who lost their lives, we send our sincerest aroha and love. Kia kaha. Kia ora.</p>

            <strong>Hon JOHN BOSCAWEN (Deputy Leader—ACT)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> I rise today on behalf of the ACT Party to express our heartfelt sorrow at the deaths of Rodney Miller, Chaminda Senadhira, Adam Bennett, Michael Suter, and Christopher McDonald; and the young tourists: Patrick Byrne from Ireland, Glenn Bourke from Australia, Annita Kirsten from Germany, and Brad Coker from England—the nine people killed when their plane crashed at Fox Glacier in the South Island on Saturday afternoon. This is the worst aviation disaster that New Zealand has suffered in the last 17 years. The ACT Party joins all other members of this House in sending our deepest condolences to the families, friends, and loved ones of those who lost their lives on that afternoon. The death of a loved one—be it a father, a mother, a brother, a sister, a son, a daughter, a partner, or a friend—in such particularly tragic circumstances is one of the most painful
 ordeals that one can experience. My heart, and the hearts of my caucus colleagues, go out to the victims’ loved ones in their time of grief.</p>
          <a name="page_13682"></a>
          <p class="a">On behalf of the ACT Party, I wish to also express our deepest sympathies to the two young girlfriends who witnessed their boyfriends perish in that disaster. Anyone who has seen the television coverage over the last 24 to 48 hours cannot help but be moved by the interview given by the sister of Glenn Bourke. She talked about her own experiences of skydiving in New Zealand and how she encouraged her younger brother to come and to follow in her footsteps.</p>
          <p class="a">No words of mine can mitigate the pain and the sorrow that the friends and the loved ones of the nine victims must be feeling, but I hope they can take even a little solace in the knowledge that the thoughts of every member of this House, indeed of the entire nation, are with them at this terrible time, and that Parliament has seen fit to honour the lives of their loved ones with this special motion this afternoon. Thank you.</p>

Ko te ingoa Māori mō tēnei wāhi Fox Glacier, ko Te Moeka o Tuawe. Ko tēnei tupuna a Tuawe i hinga, ā, ka mate i a ia e torotoro haere nei i te whenua. Koinei i kīa ai, ko te moenga, te moeka rānei o Tuawe. Ko tana whaiāipo, tana wahine i tangi.

          <p class="a">[<em>Greetings once again to us all, the House. To those who died tragically: slumber and rest there. You came because of your desire to see and view the great things that New Zealand offers, including the forests and lakes, but you have been tragically taken instead. So farewell, slumber, rest, and sleep there in the arms of the unseen place.</em><strong></strong></p>
          <p class="a">
            <em>Each year, tourists come here to New Zealand to see the beauty of our country. Some come to places such as the Franz Josef Glacier and Fox Glacier, icons of New
 Zealand. When they see the ice and forests they are amazed. But just recently we have heard about the tragic loss of life taken by the powerful hand of death. However, this kind of tragedy has historical implications. The Māori name for this place, Fox Glacier, is Te Moeka o Tuawe. The ancestor Tuawe fell and died while exploring the land. That is why it was called the resting place of Tuawe. His lover and wife wept. Her name was Hine Hukatere. Her tears flowed and the Franz Josef Glacier was created. The name of this place in Māoridom is Kā Roimata o Hine Hukatere, Hine Hukatere’s tears. That is the explanation for that death.

            <em>We should note that 17 years ago nine people died here, as well—Hine Hukatere’s situation was revisited. Seventeen years ago some people died in an October 1993 plane crash. The two pilots and the seven tourists aboard all perished. Now we come to these people last Saturday, who suffered a similar fate. They all died, like Tuawe. The situation relating to Hine Hukatere is repeated. These follow the tragedy of 17 years ago when tourists lost their lives, and now we come to this one on Saturday. Enough, I say.

            <em>But there is a message there somewhere. As in the situation facing the people of Christchurch, we need to be cautious. I would simply like to say to families left forlorn and grieving that they rest. In regard to those who have passed on, let them go. There is little else that can be done. But for us, the living, I simply say that we pursue the words expressed by others: be strong, courageous, and stout of heart so it can be stated that the lines are united and joined. Allow those who have passed on to rest there. We, the living, are the ones who will follow in their footsteps. Be staunch, the family, and families. Let us all be strong and helpful for each other. Greetings to us.</em>

            <strong>Hon PETER DUNNE (Leader—United Future)</strong>
            <strong>:</strong> Just as the peace and tranquillity of a crisp Canterbury morning were shattered early on Saturday by the brutality of the earthquake, so, too, were the peace and tranquillity of a warm, late winter’s afternoon in South Westland shattered by the horror of the air crash at Fox Glacier, which killed nine people. I share the support of others for the motion of condolence to the friends and families of all those who lost their lives in that tragedy. I simply make the observation that around New Zealand, as we value our great outdoors lifestyle, these forms of adventure tourism take place day in and day out, and often no second thought is given to the potential risk or danger involved. That is what makes a tragedy like what happened on Saturday afternoon all the more hard to comprehend. By all accounts a routine event went terribly, terribly wrong and nine people lost their lives. It is not the time to speculate on the whys and wherefores; it is the time to concentrate on the consequences for the families and the affected communities, to acknowledge their suffering and their sadness, and to express as a Parliament our support for them at this difficult moment.</p>
