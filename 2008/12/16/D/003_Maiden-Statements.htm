          <strong>Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</strong>: Honourable members, as was the practice during previous maiden statements, I would ask that when each member has concluded we refrain from congratulatory responses, so that all members have a fair chance to be able to make their maiden statements.</p>

          <strong>SIMON BRIDGES (National—Tauranga)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> Nearly every maiden speech that I have read has begun with the member congratulating Mr Speaker on his appointment to high office, and I congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and also Mr Speaker, the Hon Lockwood Smith. I congratulate the Hon Lockwood Smith not only as a matter of professional courtesy but because of our personal friendship, going back to a beer we shared at Auckland University’s Shadows bar when he was getting a hard time as education Minister and I was a pimply young Nat.</p>
        <p class="a">Indeed, I joined the National Party at a young age, not because of any longstanding family connection to the greatest political party in the history of our nation but because then, as now, I believed in less not more government, in individuals doing as much for themselves as possible, and in reward for hard work and enterprise. Then, as now, I was generally economically dry and socially conservative, but never unthinkingly or uncaringly so. We need to do what works, not what sounds good in theory.
 In human affairs matters are often shades of grey, and not simply black or white. In economic times like these, rigid adherence to orthodoxies may not solve things for ordinary Kiwis. World-class health and education systems are essential. New Zealanders clearly understand this, and voted on 8 November for a John Key - led Government and the fresh approach to our nation’s challenges that it brings; they voted to move away from a slavish adherence to ideology, towards a new style of politics that is inclusive, dignified, and decent, and that believes that politics can be noble and deliver greater justice.</p>
        <p class="a">Can I today in this hallowed hall acknowledge my wonderful family and my amazing wife. My mother is from Waihī dairy-farming stock and my father from Frankton in Hamilton. Like so many in this nation, my mother’s ancestors came from England, while my father’s mother, Naku Joseph, was Ngāti Maniapoto and came from rural Ōpārure, near Te Kūiti. She remained in an unhappy relationship with her hard-living husband, Alf Bridges, because in those days early last century she thought that marriage to a Pākehā man was bettering herself and her children’s prospects. She continually told my father that she wanted her children and grandchildren to have letters behind their names, without really understanding what that meant. The dysfunction my father grew up with, and the sacrificial example he saw from his mother, played large roles in his becoming a Baptist minister and dedicating his life to service in many parts of New Zealand.</p>
        <p class="a">All my childhood and teenage years were in Te Atatū North. Just as my father has lived a life of service, so has my mother—bringing up six children of whom I am the youngest by some way. All six of us children, despite a lack of material wealth, have gone on to higher education, the surest path from poverty to prosperity that I know of.</p>
        <p class="a">In relation to my amazing wife Natalie, I acknowledge my debt of gratitude to her. She has sacrificed a lot because of my journey to Parliament. She is the daughter of a Welshman and a Polish woman, and she and I met in England while both of us were studying at Oxford University. She is here in New Zealand because she married a Kiwi. New Zealand must develop a fuller policy for stemming the brain drain than intermarriage; a John Key - led Government will.</p>
        <p class="a">My story is that I am the product of the wonderful family and world-class health and education systems with which I grew up. I am grateful to all hues of Government for the provision of health and education systems of such a standard. Following on from degrees at Auckland and Oxford universities, I have worked as a litigation lawyer and a Crown prosecutor, prosecuting over a hundred jury trials in the last several years in my electorate, Tauranga. These trials have included trials for the city’s worst murderers, rapists, drug dealers, and violent offenders.</p>
        <a name="page_733"></a>
        <p class="a">Martin Luther King Jnr once said that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, and in many jury trials I have seen injustices—indeed, manifest indignities—performed on the weakest in our society as court rules worked against them. We need to make law that redraws the balance between victim and community on the one hand and criminal accused on the other. Victims and the community deserve better than the so-called justice I have seen served up to them on occasion, and although there has been tinkering previously, more reform is needed to make the jury trial a more just institution. In short, juries need to be trusted with more information, and victims need to be treated more evenly when compared with accused.</p>
        <p class="a">Just as constant vigilance and scrutiny are required in relation to the ancient tradition of the jury trial, so is diligence necessary regarding our rules for elections and our constitutional arrangements. Nothing is ever perfect; there is always a better way.</p>
        <p class="a">My already-mentioned ancestry or whakapapa, of course, makes me who I am. In reference to it again, let us remember what another MP for Tauranga, the Rt Hon Winston Peters, said in his maiden speech to this House, which is equally apposite for myself: “I am a New Zealander, I am a Māori, and I am also a lawyer. New Zealand is not a monotonous garden where every flower is the same; it is a garden where the diversity of the blooms enriches the view.” The diversity of my ancestry enriches my outlook, and deepens my empathy for all New Zealanders, no matter their race or background.</p>
        <p class="a">Can I at this point acknowledge Winston Peters, whom I stood against in Tauranga. As I said on the evening of the election, Winston Peters, I respect you, and I acknowledge that I learnt a lot from you while we jousted on the campaign. You have been amongst the very longest-serving members in this House, and now you are no longer here. You will nevertheless be long remembered, and I wish you well in the future. Can I also acknowledge another colourful Tauranga politician—we seem to have had a few of them—Bob Clarkson. Bob, you have been a great servant of Tauranga, inside and out of Parliament, and you put National back on the map in Tauranga. I know that your high level of service will continue, and I also wish you well in the future.</p>
        <p class="a">Tauranga has attracted politicians of colour because it is a place of singular loveliness. Its beaches, weather, and people are special, and renowned throughout our nation. Tauranga is a jewel in the crown that is our nation. And no longer is it the sleepy little seaside village of yesteryear. Since the early 1980s it has grown exponentially from approximately 50,000 people to become a vibrant city of the future with a population of over 110,000. School rolls have burgeoned as young families have flooded in. A baby boom has occurred in our city. In years to come, and perhaps even while I am still privileged to represent it, Greater Tauranga is, on some estimates, set to rival both Hamilton and Wellington in population terms. Accordingly, National Ministers can be assured I will fiercely advocate my city’s cause on the back of a strong case based on growth in numbers, now and going forward.</p>
        <p class="a">As a student in Te Atatū North and then at Auckland and Oxford universities, and later as a professional in Auckland and then in Tauranga, I have always kept the fire of my politics alight. Indeed, since 1992 I have continuously held office in the National Party, at nearly all levels.</p>
        <p class="a">Although to many this is not a selling point, I say to this House that I have long dreamt of standing here and delivering my maiden speech. Just as in some quarters it is no longer de rigueur to believe in jury trials, so in others Parliament is a place out of fashion. Nevertheless I believe in it, and want to do all I can to uphold its integrity and central position in our society. As I have said, I have long dreamt of standing here and delivering my maiden speech. I have wanted to, for my ancestors and family and for my future family and people. I have wanted to, as a pimply young Nat and now as a man in
 his 30s, because then and now I have realised that Parliament is a place that matters. This is still the place that makes a difference to the Naku Josephs of yesteryear, and to the Simon Bridgeses of tomorrow. This is still the place that can deliver world-class health and education systems, and can ensure that individuals get ahead regardless of their race or background.</p>
        <a name="page_734"></a>
        <p class="a">Although it is perhaps unusual to quote from a valedictory speech in a maiden speech, let us remember former British Prime Minister Tony Blair’s final words to the House of Commons last year: “to all my colleagues from different political parties. Some may belittle politics but we who are engaged in it know that it is where people stand tall. Although I know it has many harsh contentions, it is still the arena that sets the heart beating a little faster. If it is, on occasions, the place of low skulduggery, it is more often the place for the pursuit of noble causes.” My prayer in this House is to always pursue noble causes and greater justice on behalf of all who need it in Tauranga and further afield; to be in the service of those ends and no other master.</p>
        <p class="a">Can I end by once again congratulating you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and Mr Speaker, the Hon Lockwood Smith, and by thanking my wonderful family, my amazing wife, my multitude of terrific Tauranga supporters, and my God for getting me here.</p>

          <strong>TIM MACINDOE (National—Hamilton West)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> E ngā mana, e ngā reo, e ngā karangatanga maha ahakoa nō whea, ahakoa ko wai, mai i te Whare Pāremata nei, ā, puta atu ki ngā tōpito o Aotearoa, ā, puta atu ki te ao whānui tonu, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa. E tū ana ahau hei māngai mō Kirikiriroa ki te Hauāuru ki roto o Waikato nō reira, he mihi hoki ki a Kīngi Tuheitia, te pou herenga waka, pai mārire. He mihi hoki ki te whare ariki o te Heuheu o Ngāti Tūwharetoa. Ka mihi hoki ki ō tātou tūpuna mātua i haina nei i te Tiriti o Waitangi i tērā rau tau. Ko tō rātou wawata, kia noho tahi rātou hei iwi kotahi. Nō reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa.</p>
        <ul class="">
          <li>[An interpretation in English was given to the House.]</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="a">[<em>To the powers, languages, and many callings, regardless where and whom, from within this House of Parliament, to the extremities of New Zealand and out to the world at large, greetings to you, greetings to you, and greetings to you all. I stand as representative of Hamilton West, Waikato, and therefore acknowledge King Tuheitia, the mooring pillar of canoes. Good and peaceful tidings. Greetings also to the noble house of te Heuheu of Ngāti Tūwharetoa. Acknowledgments as well to our ancestors who signed the Treaty of Waitangi in the past hundred years. Their wish was that they live together as one. So greetings to you, greetings to you, and greetings to us all</em><strong></strong>.]</p>
        <p class="a">Mr Deputy Speaker, I join other members in congratulating you and your three colleagues on your election. Your collective dignity, patience, and humour will serve you and us well in the years ahead, although I dare say all those qualities will be tested from time to time.</p>
        <p class="a">I also extend my respects to His Excellency the Governor-General. I am proud of our constitutional heritage and Westminster traditions, and a firm believer in the institution of the Commonwealth. It is a pleasure to see the House presided over this afternoon by my friend the member for Waikato, not only because we are from the same region but because you, sir, walked an equally long and uphill path on your journey to this place. I say to members that I lost the selection contest in the then Karapiro electorate to Mr Tisch 9 years ago, and subsequently served on his first campaign committee. Sir, I thank you for returning the favour this year as my caucus mentor on my campaign committee and for your encouragement over many years.</p>
        <p class="a">I also wanted to greet my colleague Dr Hutchison. I lost a selection contest to that member in the Port Waikato electorate 10 years ago. At the end of it he promised me hospitality in Bellamy’s at a mutually convenient time. I had hoped the good doctor
 would share my view that tonight would be an ideal time for him to recall his generous offer but I am advised that he took one look at my rather large contingent of family and friends in the gallery today and fled the country. To my other fellow Waikato MPs on both sides of the House, greetings, especially to my friends from across our beautiful river.</p>
        <a name="page_735"></a>
        <p class="a">I lost the selection contest to David Bennett in Hamilton East 4 years ago. At the time I was mystified but I came to understand some time later when our local paper named him the Waikato’s sexiest politician. When not striding the catwalk, David Bennett is very active at home and I welcome the opportunity to work closely with him for the good of our city.</p>
        <p class="a">Like Mr Speaker, I have aspired from a tender age to serve in this House so I am humbled and a bit emotional to be here in my cramped corner at the back of the House, at last delivering my maiden speech, having been a candidate in every general election New Zealand has held under the MMP system. In fact, this is the second time I have risen to take a call. I was alarmed to receive a Hansard transcript to check last Saturday afternoon, and I thank members for this courtesy as it would have been hugely deflating after five attempts to enter this House if my doomed attempt to move a closure motion under urgency had been recorded for posterity as my maiden speech. At least I could have imagined that members would remember every word of it, although given the difficulties some of my colleagues experienced with the motion’s construction, perhaps even that small consolation would have been denied me.</p>
        <p class="a">My first real opportunity—or so I thought—came in Tauranga in 2002. To the wonderful team who supported me there, led by Sandy Garland, Barbara Steele, and Margaret Townshend, my warm regards and gratitude. I shall mention one other young lady from that campaign in a moment. In retrospect, it was not a great year to be National’s candidate against a resurgent Winston Peters. Timing is everything in politics! I watched with admiration Bob Clarkson achieve my goal 3 years later and I am delighted that Simon Bridges has now secured such a strong mandate in that city.</p>
        <p class="a">No candidate could have wished for a more professional or loyal committee than I enjoyed this year in Hamilton West under the inspiring leadership of Ken Williamson. Three of them are here today: Lance and Dulcie Coombes, and Peter Osborne; so is my youngest supporter, Andrew Osborne, and his brother Craig. Others are watching at home with my electorate chair: Barbara Weedon, who very capably leads our dedicated electorate executive. To the committee and executive team and all who supported our campaign in a myriad of ways this year, I extend heartfelt thanks and my pleasure that your commitment resulted in success. Similarly, to the party’s board and leadership, to our regional team led by Jo Stuart, the ever-helpful Alison Renwick, and my campaign secretary Jenny Kain, my sincere thanks. Ours was a true team effort but I am sure that none of my team will mind if I single out Dulcie Coombes for a special mention. Her efforts, generosity, and unfailing enthusiasm are humbling. Every candidate needs a Dulcie—thank you, FG!</p>
        <p class="a">Politics is in my blood. My paternal grandfather was an Auckland City councillor, Auckland Harbour Board member, and a friend of former Prime Minister Gordon Coates. His son and daughter-in-law—my parents—had been members of the National Party for more than half a century when my father died, and my mother remains an enthusiastic member and supporter. As a child I remember endless debates in our home between my parents and their farming friends from Ngāhinapōuri, south-west of Hamilton, over whether Sir Keith Holyoake or Sir Les Munro would make a better leader of the National Party. It struck me then as a strange way to socialise, but something obviously rubbed off on their youngest child for, by the time I was 13 and
 glued to the televised coverage of the State funeral of Prime Minister Norman Kirk, I was hooked.</p>
        <a name="page_736"></a>
        <p class="a">I have not spent all of the intervening time campaigning but I think my wife and children might dispute that. To my wife Anne, whom I do not thank often enough but who is with me still, after five consecutive general elections in which I have actively campaigned, I extend heartfelt thanks and my love.
 She is here today with our younger daughter, Jessica. Anne and I celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary last month, and I am so proud of the family that we have raised. I am pleased that my elder sister Janne, brother Guy, and godson Oliver, are with Anne, Jessica, and my mother today in the gallery. All my family supported and encouraged my ambition over many years. This is their day as much as it is mine.</p>
        <p class="a">I feel keenly the absence of three people whom I always envisaged being here for this moment, each of whom greatly encouraged my political thinking and involvement. One is the remarkable Mrs Ursula McGrath, who is watching her boys—Simon Bridges and Tim Macindoe—with her family in Tauranga this afternoon. At nearly 87 her energy, determination, and Christian faith are an example to my generation. Her unwavering support for my candidacy, and hard work in Tauranga 6 years ago, were hugely encouraging during a campaign that was hardly a morale-boosting experience in other respects. We share a desire to see our nation’s children taught the values that underpin patriotism, moral courage, and good citizenship. All that Mrs McGrath would ever ask for from me would be that I keep working for those ideals, and I give her that commitment today.</p>
        <p class="a">The second was my brother-in-law, Gerald Smith, the son of those farming friends from Ngāhinapōuri, whom I mentioned earlier. He first brought me to this House 31 years ago as a guest of his local MP, Barry Brill, when I was still a schoolboy. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer at Christmas last year. For nearly 40 years Gerald farmed on top of the Paekākāriki Hill, demonstrating a work ethic, commitment to his family, and strength of character that made a lasting impression on me.</p>
        <p class="a">The third was my father, Harley Macindoe, a businessman and a sportsman, but, most of all, a family man. Sadly, he, too, is no longer with us, having died less than a fortnight before the 2005 general election. He and my mother, Jill, gave their children the security and example of a stable home, with much love, a lot of hospitality, and plenty of encouragement and opportunities. Dad was no saint, but his virtues were many. I feel his presence on my shoulder today, knowing how proud he was of all his children and what this moment would have meant to him, and what it does mean to my mother.</p>
        <p class="a">I also acknowledge with love and gratitude close family members who are unable to be here: my elder daughter Sarah, two of my sisters—Sally and Belinda, and their families—and my parents-in-law, Michael and Joan Murray.</p>
        <p class="a">My parents made me who I am today, and I am convinced that parenting is our greatest responsibility in life. Strong families are our best hope for healthy communities. We should always consider the consequences for our families of decisions made in this House. I am a former teacher, a former public servant, a former Otago University student politician, a former student of Dr Michael Cullen—and of the deputy mayor of Wellington—a former prison tutor at Christchurch Women’s Prison, a Kiwibank customer, a follower and advocate for the performing arts, and a very proud member of the National Party, and at last of this honourable House.</p>
        <p class="a">My political role models include “Gentlemen Jack” Marshall, Brian Talboys, and George Gair, National MPs who served our country with distinction; but I also admired Bill Rowling for his intelligence and dignity, David Lange for his wit and humanity,
 and many who still serve in this House but will have to wait a little longer for their tributes.</p>
        <a name="page_737"></a>
        <p class="a">Eight MPS have served as MPs for Hamilton West since its inception in 1969. They include the aforementioned Sir Les; Dorothy Jelicich; the colourful Mike Minogue, who passed away just over a fortnight ago; the very much alive Trevor Mallard; my friends Grant Thomas and Bob Simcock, who both, since leaving this House, have served our city with distinction on our city council, where Bob continues to provide outstanding leadership as our mayor; and most recently, Martin Gallagher. Three years ago I lost a close contest to Martin. While we debated issues vigorously that year and this, we always did in an atmosphere of mutual respect without acrimony or personal attacks, despite the additional pressure that those who campaign in marginal electorates always face. Martin generously acknowledged my contribution in the Address in Reply debate that followed his re-election in 2005. Today I place on record not only my respect and appreciation for the contribution that Martin Gallagher made during 12 years of service as the member of Parliament for Hamilton West, but also the gratitude of my new constituents from across party lines. Martin is a Hamiltonian through and through. He was highly regarded in our city as a diligent and likable constituency MP. His concession on election night was gracious and generous. I thank him sincerely and know that he will continue to contribute positively to Hamilton, albeit in a different capacity in years to come.</p>
        <p class="a">As has been noted by many speakers in this debate, the new Government faces major economic challenges and could scarcely have taken office in more difficult circumstances. I am wholly committed to my party’s determination to implement an ambitious programme to secure strong economic growth for our country. Time and time again, during our recent election campaign, the good folk of Hamilton West voiced their concern to me that their children and grandchildren love their country but no longer feel that it offers them a fair deal or meets their expectations in the delivery of social services or the maintenance of safe, caring communities.</p>
        <p class="a">Both sides of my family were among the early generations of European settlers in this country and I am incredibly proud and grateful to be a New Zealander. But like many members of this House I have also spent many years living abroad, and I am fortunate to have had that experience. It taught me to appreciate the freedom, beauty, cultural diversity, and lifestyle that we sometimes take for granted, but which are such treasured features of our shared heritage. Professionally, it taught me a great deal that proved valuable in my former career.</p>
        <p class="a">Our children were born in the UK and may well appreciate in years to come the benefits of holding both New Zealand and European passports. While we were away for more than 5 years we never doubted that we would return to New Zealand, because this was where we wanted our children to grow up and to think of as home. That was nearly 20 years ago. Today I fear that young parents in a similar position still feel the tug of home, but resist it because they see a low-wage, high-tax economy that does not adequately reward enterprise and hard work or provide a social climate conducive to safe, healthy lifestyles. For many, New Zealand has become merely a holiday destination for grandchildren to meet their grandparents and to glimpse the country of their parents’ birth. I pray that during the next decade we will change that worrying perception. I want our children and theirs to see a worthwhile future here, to be proud of this country, their country, and to contribute fully to making it “God’s own country” once more. Securing sustained economic growth, a fair and balanced tax system, and higher living standards across all sectors of society will be vital to achieve to that vision.</p>
        <a name="page_738"></a>
        <p class="a">I applaud the decision to channel more of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund into New Zealand projects, which will preserve and create jobs, and accelerate our crucial infrastructural development. Most vital of all projects, of course, is the completion of the Waikato Expressway.</p>
        <p class="a">But I am convinced that the greatest challenges that our country faces, and which our generation of parliamentarians must tackle with all the conviction and energy that we can muster, are environmental and social. Whatever one’s view of the subject of climate change, or the best means to reduce carbon emissions, it is clearly desirable for us all to do our bit to save our planet. We can and must aim to protect and enhance our environment.</p>
        <p class="a">When the Prime Minister, as the new leader of our party, delivered his landmark “underclass” speech in January of last year, I was delighted. He highlighted some of the major concerns that have motivated me to keep seeking a political career for as long as I have. We have major problems and must tackle them with all the energy we can muster, both at source to overcome them, and in the courts to protect our citizens. The P culture, in particular, must be confronted. As I was reminded last night at Rhode Street School’s prize-giving in my electorate, our country is blessed with many good schools, and with talented committed staff, all dealing directly with major challenges and the greatest hopes of the 21st century. Let us do everything we can to encourage and promote teaching as a career for our young people. We have in our city a younger than average population and more PhDs per head of population than anywhere else in the country. Our university is a national leader in several disciplines; the Waikato Institute of Technology, now known as Wintec, is equally dynamic and world class; and our local wānanga campus is catering for many who would never previously have aspired to tertiary education.</p>
        <p class="Intervention">
          <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I think we have a slight problem here. The member obviously has a time problem. I think members on this side would be happy if leave were sought for him to complete his speech.</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</strong>: Leave is sought for that purpose. Is there any objection? Thank you. Continue, Tim Macindoe.</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>TIM MACINDOE</strong>: I entered this House with hopes and a vision for a generation. Perhaps we need to change our perception of what constitutes success. It could mean breaking a cycle of violence or dependency, or it could mean working as a volunteer in one of the myriad of vital not-for-profit or community agencies. It could mean overcoming an addiction or accepting a job that others shun. I believe that all honest work is inherently valuable. I admire those at the margins of our society who often work long and unsociable hours for modest pay in vital but unseen roles. They deserve the real honours.</p>
        <p class="a">To our support partners in the new Government, I look forward to a constructive relationship as we set about implementing our shared vision for a better New Zealand. Especially to our colleagues in the Māori Party, kia ora tātou. Thank you for the courage and leadership those members have demonstrated. I share their aspirations for improved and mana-enhancing opportunities for their people, firmly believing that what is good for Māori is good for our country as a whole. I am absolutely committed to building a lasting relationship between our parties that is founded on mutual respect, trust, and an overriding belief in the mana and potential of every human being. Kia kaha! Similarly, I commit myself to serve the people of Hamilton West with vigour and integrity. May God bless all members of this House, and grant us his wisdom and compassion in our service to our nation.</p>

From Maketū to Tongariro also, the anchorage of Te Arawa. ’Tis the sneeze of life! To the many deaths of the day who have passed on, farewell, depart, rest in eternal peace.

So, greetings to you, Mr Assistant Speaker, and to us, the House. Greetings.</em><strong></strong>]</p>
        <p class="a">Firstly, let me offer my congratulations to Mr Speaker. His elevation to the highest office in this House is a testament to the long and distinguished public service he has given. I also congratulate my fellow inductees on both sides of the House. We join experienced and wise counsel as we start to share in the mantle of responsibility for overseeing the country’s affairs. In accepting that challenge, we each have a valuable contribution to make, but in my view what is really important is that we remind ourselves daily what that value proposition is.</p>
        <p class="a">I want to return to that theme a little later. For now let me say that politics was furthest from my mind in my formative years, so much so that I had no concept of our country’s democratic processes until my mid-teens, and then only because for about a 3-week period prior to an election there seemed much ado about nothing, following which everything appeared to return to normal.</p>
        <p class="a">In many ways my life has trodden a familiar path, rooted in the traditions of a Catholic rural upbringing, exposed to the idealisms of university life, and a career that in the early years traversed the public sector, and, for a much longer period thereafter, has been roughed up by the realities of the commercial and voluntary sectors. Throughout I have been driven by the mantra of standing up for what I believe in, whether it be as a committee member of the Marist St Pats Rugby Club, because I believe taking part in sport and recreation is just one of many ways for our youth to start achieving their potential, or as a servant of Ngāti Awa, resolving a Treaty claim.</p>
        <p class="a">The reason I now stand in this House before you, Mr Assistant Speaker, is not because I have had an ambition to be a member of Parliament, but because I became increasingly concerned at the direction the last administration was taking this country. I believe that there are two primary functions to being a member of Parliament, both of equal importance. The first is to represent the people of New Zealand. In the case of a constituent member of Parliament, that manifests itself in representing one’s electorate and the citizens within that electorate. The decisions this House makes affect the ordinary lives of every person in every electorate. It is something we must never lose sight of. Speaking of electorates, I would welcome the opportunity of working through the issues confronting Hutt South with that electorate’s member of Parliament. Now that he has me to turn to, Hutt South is likely to be able to reverse the declining socio-economic indicators that have been occurring in that electorate for some time. The issues confronting residents in Hutt South—</p>

          <strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Eric Roy)</strong>: Order!</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>PAUL QUINN</strong>: —are the same as those facing all electorates—</p>
        <p class="Intervention">
          <strong>Hon John Key</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am sorry to interrupt the member’s speech. There is a longstanding convention that members’ maiden speeches are not interrupted, and members can take it on the chin from time to time if a member wants to make a comment. If Mr Mallard cannot control himself, I suggest that he goes back to his office.</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: Speaking to the point of order—</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Eric Roy)</strong>: I do not need any assistance; please sit. I did chastise the member. It is a long-held tradition; there will be no interjections.</p>
        <p class="Intervention">
          <strong>Hon Trevor Mallard</strong>: I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is not a long-term tradition. There have been points of order on maiden speeches on many occasions, and they occur on the occasions when individuals breach their responsibility to be non-controversial. That member did that then.</p>
        <p class="Interjection">
          <strong>The ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Eric Roy)</strong>: Certainly, it has been my experience in this House, which goes back to 1993. It is the first experience I have had of it, and I would ask the member to contain himself.</p>
        <p class="ContinueSpeech">
          <strong>PAUL QUINN</strong>: The issues confronting residents in Hutt South are the same as those facing all electorates; that is, a desperate lack of front-line services. In Hutt South that translates into 3,000 residents not having their own doctor because of the general practitioner shortage. Violent crime is on the increase, businesses are closing, and unemployment is rising. I have no doubt that the policies this Government campaigned on to address these and other challenges facing this country are the right ones.</p>
        <p class="a">I believe that the second primary role members of Parliament have is to provide the leadership necessary to ensure New Zealand is once again acknowledged as a pre-eminent member of the world community. Bookend comments attributable to a very senior member of the previous administration, both made within the precincts of this building, to me encapsulate everything that was wrong with its oversight of the country. The first, made in August 2000, was the words “We won. You lost. Eat that!”. That sneering comment set a reference point for what was to prove a downward-spiralling series of behaviours that oozed negativity and did not engender the leadership necessary to capitalise on years of economic opportunity. The other bookend comment, made as the country was winding up in readiness for this year’s election, was words to the effect that the election was a fight for power. A fight for power is a fight for control, which in turn is a fight to have command over our lives. It is what ordinary New Zealanders refer to as the nanny State. The annals of history will record that the people rejected that style of administration at the ballot box this year.</p>
        <p class="a">Instead, the people of New Zealand have opted for the National Party leadership model, one based on a value set that provides equal opportunity for all, protects individual freedoms, embraces choice, encourages innovation and enterprise, and inspires aspiration. Everyone is encouraged to achieve his or her potential. That is why I am proud to stand today as part of a National Government and acknowledge the already outstanding leadership of our Prime Minister, and I look forward to contributing, under his leadership, to the team effort. That team effort includes a partnership with the Māori Party—a partnership that I welcome.
 Ngā rangatira tēnā koutou, kei te mihi ki a koutou.</p>
        <p class="a">[<em>Greetings to you, esteemed ones; I acknowledge you</em><strong></strong>.]
 </p>
        <p class="a">There has been hysterical denunciation of this partnership in some quarters. This denunciation is an affront to freedom of choice, as have been the accusations levelled at the Māori Party last week by the Opposition during the passage of the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Bill through its various stages. Labour members accuse the Māori Party of selling Māori short, when under their watch the average income of
 Māori has gone from being 84 percent of what Pākehā earn to 77 percent. The facts speak for themselves. Under the previous administration most Māori socio-economic indicators deteriorated. No wonder “closing the gaps” disappeared from the vernacular.</p>
        <a name="page_741"></a>
        <p class="a">For some time now I have publicly stated my view that the Māori Party is a natural coalition partner for the National Party. Why? Because our value sets are aligned. We are both fiercely protective of property rights. We are both focused on aspirational pathways. We are both determined to provide a framework whereby everyone has an equal opportunity to achieve his or her potential. All the paradigm advances that have occurred to move Māori forward in this country’s short history have, in my view, occurred under a National Government: the setting up of Apirana Ngata’s land reforms; the introduction of wānanga; kohanga reo; Te Māngai Pāho; the Te Reo Maori Television Trust; the fisheries settlement; the first Raupatu settlement; and subsequent Treaty settlement processes were driven by a National Government. I welcome the Māori Party as a team member in this Government, and I look forward to working with them in advancing the cause of Māoridom—kia kaha.</p>
        <p class="a">Of particular interest to me in this regard is expediting Treaty settlement processes. It is but one specific reason why I now stand in this House. It is my response to the total lack of leadership provided by the previous administration in getting on with the job, particularly when it was obvious that there was a better way. I note that it magically found that better way some 6 months out from an election. Another concern is getting the Crown to abide by the commitment to partnership set out in Treaty settlements once those settlements had been agreed. By way of example, Ngāti Awa has had to go to the High Court and the Court of Appeal to demonstrate that the words in their deed of settlement, finally executed in April 2005, mean what they say. One would think, after four comprehensive defeats and no victories, the message might have got through, particularly given some of the findings in the judgments, but, sadly, not. I look forward to the leadership my friend and colleague the Hon Chris Finlayson will bring to this portfolio in ensuring enduring settlements are expedited in the spirit of partnership.</p>
        <p class="a">I now return to the value proposition. This Government has committed itself to going for growth in the knowledge that only through real economic growth will our country once again be able to provide the aspirational pathways that improve the lives of every New Zealander. The great moments of history were achieved against a simple focused vision: Abraham Lincoln set out to abolish slavery and unite a country; John F Kennedy challenged his country to send a man to the moon before the decade of the 1970s arrived; and Bill Gates took the computer to the home. Of course, we have our own icons to look up to. Lord Rutherford and Sir Edmund Hillary are but two. A third is Sir Peter Blake and Team New Zealand, who benchmarked everything they did against one simple test: will it make the boat go faster? Our partnership with another of our team members, the ACT Party, calls for the closing of the income gap with our near neighbours by 2025. It is a laudable goal, but what happens if Australia slips back or if we pass them by 2015? Whatever we agree on, we need to be ready to respond to the challenges of the world. That will take dynamism, energy, enthusiasm, and a fair degree of business smarts. That is what today’s modern National Party brings to New Zealand at this critical time.</p>
        <p class="a">There is one other very important member of our Government team that must be acknowledged, and that is the Public Service, for it is the Public Service that helps the Government do its work. I have no doubt that under this Government the mana of a neutral Public Service will be restored so that it can, in complete confidence, give free and frank advice. My one reservation is that at times a silo mentality can be adopted by some departments. We must move past this by bringing greater cohesion, and have all departments, each day, challenge themselves with the question: “How are we
 contributing to growth today?”. I am proud to be part of a Government that is going for growth. Everything I do as a member of this House will be benchmarked against that, and everything we do in this House should strive for the same. That is what this Government’s leadership is focused on, and that is what must drive the Public Service. Our guardianship of this country is, in relative terms, for a short time. Our responsibility is to leave it a better place for those who follow.</p>
        <a name="page_742"></a>
        <p class="a">My arrival in this House is not the end of a journey, but the beginning of a challenge. In concluding, I have already acknowledged Ngāti Awa, my family, and their support for me. I now take the opportunity to acknowledge the National Party and its Wellington metro branches, and, in particular, its president, Judy Kirk, who has encouraged and cajoled me in moments of doubt. I also take this opportunity to record my indebtedness to certain other people: Ursula Quinn, the Sisters of Compassion, Therese Pimley, Peter McCormack, Rose and Bernard Grant, Rolland O’Regan, and Reg and Geraldine Power. Without their care and support, I would not be standing here today. But most of all I thank my wife, Viv, who, although initially a reluctant participant, has none the less been prepared to put her own outstanding career on hold and to unselfishly support and allow me to pursue what I believe in. She is my beloved, my confidante, and my conscience, and I thank her. Nō reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa, kahuri.</p>

          <strong>RAYMOND HUO (Labour)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> I congratulate you, Mr Assistant Speaker, and your associates, on your appointments, and I wish you all the best for the term of this Parliament. Greetings to all members and to the diverse group of citizens that each member represents.
 你们好! Greetings to you all.</p>
        <p class="a">It is a privilege to stand and present my maiden speech to this forty-ninth New Zealand Parliament. I wish to recognise the Governor-General and the dignified calm that he brings to that office. I should like to pay my respects to the Rt Hon Helen Clark, the former Prime Minister and leader of the New Zealand Labour Party. I am very proud to have been a part of the recent campaign under Helen Clark, upon whose vision and leadership I believe history will look back favourably. Her vision and leadership have strengthened my Kiwi identity and made me proud to be a New Zealander. Equally, I am very proud to have now become the first Chinese member of the Labour caucus, serving here under the Hon Phil Goff. I recall that my very first meeting with a Labour Cabinet Minister upon seeking the nomination to run for Parliament was with Phil at his Mount Roskill electorate office. I thank Phil for his support.</p>
        <p class="a">I owe my presence here to many people whom I consider to be my mentors. To name names unfairly omits others, but some do need special mention: the Hon Chris Carter, for his passion to fight for the values the Labour Party stands for, and for his trust and confidence in me; the Hon Dr Michael Cullen; the Hon Lianne Dalziel; the Hon Darren Hughes; the Hon Judith Tizard; the Hon Maryan Street; and the Labour Party president, Mike Williams. I also pay tribute to the Hon Parekura Horomia and, through him, to all our Māori colleagues in the House, and to Aotearoa’s tangata whenua. It is to them that we owe a profound debt for the foundation they laid for a bicultural nation that is now multicultural. Kia ora.</p>
        <p class="a">Thanks also go to many of my free-thinking friends, intellectuals, and teachers: Professor Yongjin Zhang—with whom I am proud to be a fellow alumnus—and Mr Gavin Ellis, the former editor-in-chief of the
 <em>New Zealand Herald</em><strong></strong>, who duly became my first employer in New Zealand. I followed Gavin’s advice of listing all the pros and cons and adding them up to help draw a conclusion when I was not certain about vacating my legal profession in order to run for Parliament. He did not give me an
 answer, but he showed me how to get one. That reminded me of the way Gavin taught me, in the news room more than 10 years earlier, to distinguish between news and views when writing articles. However, sadly it appears that few media in this country appreciate the difference nowadays.</p>
        <a name="page_743"></a>
        <p class="a">My most heartfelt thank you is extended to my wife, Yunfang, and our children. Thank you, xiao fang, for all the love, support, and wisdom that you continue to share. I know you are watching this on the Sky TV network together with other friends and supporters at home and abroad. I am thrilled to learn that the live broadcast has been arranged via the Internet as far away as Beijing, Hong Kong, and Taipei. Thank you for your support.
 新西兰工党第一位华人国会议员,在这里向全世界华人问好!I offer my sincere greetings to Chinese all over the world from me, the first Chinese MP of the New Zealand Labour Party.</p>
        <p class="a">I am not sure whether it is appropriate, on this occasion, to thank many of my loyal clients. They often fall into a category of the most ideal clients of any law firm: rich and always in trouble. Some had troubles that were not of their own making. For instance, a young Chinese couple purchased a residential section in Auckland, but their development of this section, which was purely for residential purposes, was hampered by legislation passed in 1915 that meant consent for the required works—in this case, the excavation or cutting of less than the 40-degree minimum—could be granted only by the Governor-General. The Auckland Volcanic Cones Society demanded that work stop on the affected slope, citing the 1915 legislation. Others, however, strongly argued that the relevant provision should be repealed simply because of its redundant role.</p>
        <p class="a">I have just learnt that a bill is currently before Parliament that was postponed because of the election. Under the proposed amendment, the Minister of Conservation would be able to delegate responsibility to his or her officers, thus making the process a lot more streamlined. Currently, people must go to the Department of Conservation, then to the Minister, and then to the Governor-General, all because of a 93-year-old Act that was designed primarily for mining. This change would be beneficial for all affected parties. As one reporter following the case correctly suggested—showing a strong sense of humour—my election to Parliament represents some level of comfort both to the Auckland Volcanic Cones Society and the developers like my clients, because from now on my service to all parties is free.</p>
        <p class="a">Cases like this one make my transition from lawyer to parliamentarian much easier. I have a sense of obligation to work with all parties to create durable and effective laws. Clearly, my focus is to become the best possible advocate that I can possibly be, for the best interests of our peoples, our communities, and our society. In that regard, I trust that my fellow parliamentary colleagues from a variety of ethnic backgrounds share with me the same sense of mission—that is, to bring our migrant community members closer to mainstream society. “Mainstream” may be the wrong word, but without integration, alienation will inevitably follow. So our job, among other things, is to help communicate, build bridges, and bring people together.</p>
        <p class="a">Many will recall that much was made of the concerns of Kiwi Asians about crime rates leading up to the election. The related press coverage prompted around 15,000 people to take to the streets in Auckland to air their fears. This was despite police statistics showing an overall drop in crime, although referring to such statistics would get any messengers, including myself, into trouble. But what cannot be denied is that these people were genuinely concerned about their safety, and that they took exception to the police’s priority policy. They argued that sometimes we cannot distinguish between property-related crimes and life-threatening ones, as was demonstrated with the death of Joanne Wang after her handbag was snatched in Manukau.</p>
        <a name="page_744"></a>
        <p class="a">Many Asians have migrated from countries with civil law jurisdictions, where the inquisitorial system enables the courts to determine the truth in the first instance. When the prosecution is successful, sentencing is delivered to fit the crime and its specific circumstances, but here in New Zealand many Asians do not understand or appreciate our adversarial system of justice, or due process. When their expectation of a speedy and fair delivery of justice is not met, they often become frustrated. This is where we as MPs can help guide our new New Zealanders to understand and appreciate these differences.</p>
        <p class="a">I want to promote in this House the value of looking forward, not backward. But it is worth noting that the process of migrant integration, or settlement, requires two-way communication, not one-way application.</p>
        <p class="a">Until about the early 1970s, New Zealanders did not talk much about ethnic groups, what rights they might have, and how a variety of them might be accepted or incorporated into the political arrangements of the country. Rather, they thought about race. As Professor Andrew Sharp said at the Learning and Practising Democracy symposium in 1996, when we had our first election under MMP: “Chinese and Indians were thought of as races too, indeed as ‘race aliens’—the point of saying which was to deny that they could assimilate into the population at large.” On the other hand, Professor Sharp went on to suggest that “the more you think of yourselves as not ‘ordinary New Zealanders’ the less you will feel your interests and your cultures to be represented.”</p>
        <p class="a">I am confident that New Zealand can, and will, do remarkably well—indeed, it has already done reasonably well—in constructing a multicultural society. The rationale—if I have not oversimplified it—is that, for example, we are free and encouraged not only to be Chinese, or some variation of racial, linguistic, and ethnic Chinese, but also to be an ordinary New Zealander. To celebrate our differences is to promote our common purposes. Positive media will therefore play an important role. The ability for ethnic minorities to move from the margins of social and political life relies, largely, on the willingness of mainstream opinion to hear their voices, and the ability of the media to correctly report their differences.</p>
        <p class="a">To some extent, ethnic minorities are vulnerable. If we allow ourselves to satisfy the appetite of the commercial mass media for stereotypes in whatever form, we are facing a risk of inflating intercultural misunderstandings rather than alleviating, minimising, and overcoming them. After all, this is not just your home; this is not just my home: this is our home—our Aotearoa!</p>
        <p class="a">I came to New Zealand in 1994, and, after some initial cultural shock in terms of settling in, I came to appreciate and celebrate the differences. I regard myself as someone who is extremely lucky to have been a witness of change and transformation, not only of China under reform but also of New Zealand in an increasingly globalised era, when multiculturalism has become entrenched and when New Zealand’s identity is consistently shaped and reshaped.</p>
        <p class="a">I taught myself to speak English when I was a teenager in China by listening to the radio. This was furthered by my middle-school teachers in Qianshan and my brother-in-law, Professor Jianming Xu. Of course, he was not a professor at that time. He had the same fate as his peers, and at the age of 16 he was sent to a remote countryside to be “re-educated”. He taught himself English and science, and 20 years later he graduated from two top medical schools with one bachelor and two doctoral degrees. I followed that DIY spirit and was lucky enough—and successful enough, if I may add that—to be one of the very privileged few to attend university in China in the early 1980s.</p>
        <p class="a">My upbringing plays a big part in who I am today. My father was a doctor and my mother was a head nurse at that time. In their early 30s, they volunteered to move from
 the big city to a remote countryside town to help locals fight a parasitic disease known as
 <em>Schistosoma</em><strong></strong>, or blood fluke. On many occasions I witnessed how my parents resuscitated patients and saved them from death. This was approaching the later stage of the Cultural Revolution. Being a medical doctor working in harsh conditions in a remote countryside town did not mean you were immune from persecution. My father, like other “intellectuals”, was ordered to stand still at the main entrance to the hospital, holding a wide whiteboard with his name painted in black, followed by the title “counter-revolutionary medical expert”. Sixty minutes a session, three sessions a day—those in power believed that this would help him to be scrutinised by the public, which would eventually help him to “purify” his mind.</p>
        <a name="page_745"></a>
        <p class="a">Like any naughty 5-year-old boy could and would do, I duplicated a smaller whiteboard and voluntarily joined the roster. I even invited my father to write my name and my title on the little whiteboard with something like “little counter revolutionary medical expert”. And guess what? He did! The Cultural Revolution ended shortly afterwards, and from then on I secretly believed that it was me who brought the nationwide political turmoil to an end with my little whiteboard.</p>
        <p class="a">In hindsight, my journey to this honourable House stretches back to my birth in that small rural town, from that small stage I once shared with my father and from the desire for free will that I inherited from my parents. That experience was relevant. It influenced—and will continue to influence—my politics and world outlook. I have learnt to be resilient. I have learnt to be kind, caring, and more philosophical when confronting difficulties. To those who have asked me of my secret weapon behind successful careers in Beijing and now in New Zealand, I say it is a simple one: double your efforts, halve your expectations.</p>
        <p class="a">Let me borrow from what the Hon David Cunliffe said in his maiden speech in February 2000: “Where there is a wrong, right it; where there is injustice, fight it; where there is hunger, feed it; and where there are no jobs, find some.” I am so proud to be part of the Labour team that has striven for those very principles under the great names, including Michael Joseph Savage, Peter Fraser, Walter Nash, Norman Kirk, David Lange, and Helen Clark, and that will now continue to do so under Phil Goff. Kia ora.
 谢谢!
 Thank you.</p>

        <p class="a">[<em>Greetings to you, the political collectives of New Zealand. Greetings also to you, Mr Assistant Speaker of this House. This acknowledgment from the waters of Otago and its harbours, to you living here at the mouth of the fish—Wellington. Greetings to you collectively, and to us all</em><strong></strong>.]</p>
        <p class="a">I dedicate this speech to my grandmothers, Ellen Kinney and Peg Thompson, two strong-willed but compassionate women who would be proud, if somewhat astounded, to see me standing here today.</p>
        <p class="a">I want to talk about honesty, aspiration, and community. I stand here a New Zealander, a union member, a member of the Labour Party, a mother, and until very recently the owner of a small business.</p>
        <p class="a">I acknowledge Māori as tangata whenua and the importance of the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
        <p class="a">I thank the people of Dunedin South for putting their trust in me to represent them as their member of Parliament. I thank all the volunteers, supporters, and members of the New Zealand Labour Party who worked tirelessly on the campaign to win Dunedin South. You are the bedrock of our party. I warmly acknowledge Pete Hodgson, the MP
 for Dunedin North, and David Parker, who imparted to me much wisdom in my journey this year, and Mike Woodhouse, the new Dunedin National List MP. I hope we will all work together constructively for our city.</p>
        <a name="page_746"></a>
        <p class="a">As the first Labour woman to hold the seat of Dunedin South, I pay tribute to all the people who have come to this House before me to represent Dunedin South and St Kilda in all its various forms. David Benson-Pope has worked hard for the community and the Labour Party. It has been a hard few years for David and his family. I wish them well. Before him were the inimitable Dr Michael Cullen, Bill Fraser, James Barnes, and Fred Jones. The Dunedin South electorate has a long and proud history. For decades it has been a safe Labour seat and it remains a safe Labour seat. We are a staunch and steady lot.</p>
        <p class="a">The electorate extends from the working-class suburbs of South Dunedin, Caversham, and St Kilda, to Green Island, Fairfield, Brighton, and Mosgiel, from the lush Taieri Plains to the Lammermoor Range, and includes Graeme Sydney’s Maniototo up to Middlemarch and Hyde, which includes the beginning of the Otago Central Rail Trail and the historic Taieri Gorge Railway. The glorious coastline of St Clair and St Kilda, and the Otago Peninsula, are home to some of the rarest wildlife in the world, and my home too.</p>
        <p class="a">I am a passionate Dunedinite. I was born in Wainuiōmata but grew up in Dunedin. Like many New Zealanders, I went away to see the world and was gone for a long time Six years ago I uprooted my Australian partner and two little boys from Melbourne to return to Dunedin—the best decision we ever made. There is something special about Dunedin. We are innovative. We are edgy. We manifest the can-do attitude of New Zealanders and the stoic nature of our early settlers to take whatever life offers and make the best of it. And we do make the best of it, every day. Dunedin, particularly South Dunedin, can claim to have nurtured many of our most creative and talented people. Janet Frame and James K Baxter both hailed from Dunedin South, along with myriad other writers, painters, poets, sportspeople, and musicians. But for many in Dunedin South, the low-paid and pensioners, life is hard. Seventy percent of people over 15 have an income of $40,000 a year or less. I am here to make sure their voices are heard.</p>
        <p class="a">I was raised in a Catholic household to do the best you can for yourself, your society, and for the people around you. I hail from mostly peasant Irish stock. My father, Kinney, worked in the Department of Justice, and from him I learnt the values that underpin the Civil Service: behaving ethically, taking responsibility for your actions, and doing the right thing. My mother, Shirley, taught me with her strength and tireless commitment to voluntary work the difference between right and wrong, and to always try my best. At St Dominic’s College in Dunedin—which has produced two Labour MPs, Marian Hobbs and me—I was one of “those” Catholic girls who questioned everything, pushed boundaries, but ultimately took away strong principles of social justice and fighting to redress disadvantage. And inner strength. I pay tribute to the principal, Sister Albert, who instilled in me a sense of fairness and dignity.</p>
        <p class="a">I am not a practising Catholic, but I draw strength from the collective spirit, fellowship, and underlying values of Catholicism and many other faiths. My faith is in the ability of people to act together to do good. I have a belief in the importance of all people having a voice, whatever their background, and faith in the principles of community.</p>
        <p class="a">Becoming an MP was not a pathway I had mapped out for myself, but, rather, a combination of circumstances, timing, and my readiness. Almost my entire working life I have been driven to work on issues that affect working people and the disadvantaged. I have been motivated by a resolve to fight injustice, and I hope I always will be. My first
 political act was to protest against the Springbok Tour in 1981. I clearly recall what apartheid meant for our country at that time, and I know where I stood on that issue. But being a mother is by far my greatest motivation. The responsibility of bringing up two little people has made me focus on what I really believe, and examine my values. As my children have grown, that drive has grown stronger.</p>
        <a name="page_747"></a>
        <p class="a">I stand here today because of what I believe, and because I am committed to doing something about it. Should we not, as a nation, want more people who truly reflect our community to stand up for what they believe? It worries me that so many are disinterested in, and turned off by, politics. Why? One reason is that they fear what might happen to them. They fear that they will be exposed to unsustainable public scrutiny. Of course people standing for office should be accountable. But none of us, including me, is without blemish.</p>
        <p class="a">One of the biggest tasks ahead of us is to restore faith in politics and politicians. I believe that politicians of all parties have lost touch with the public we are trying to serve. It is not confined to New Zealand, but it is up to us to do something about it. How many of us have struck the repeated refrain from our constituents that politics is a joke, that all politicians are as bad as each other, and that the contest of politics is more important that the issues? In this latest election, more than 20 percent of registered voters did not vote, and in the Māori seats 35 to 40 percent did not vote. Is it good enough to accept that perception is the inevitable reality? No, it is not. It is time for a new politic, a new way of engaging, out of which emerges greater participation and faith in politics. We start by listening to the people around us and taking them with us. The real politic occurs in the collective beliefs and actions of people in their communities.</p>
        <p class="a">And maybe it is time to consider making voting compulsory, as it is in Australia. The ancient Greeks, who gave birth to democracy, held that it was every citizen’s duty to participate in decision making. Well, let us have the discussion.</p>
        <p class="a">I spent the 1990s in Australia, and witnessed the rise of the Howard Government, a period of great internal upheaval, and the rise of economic rationalism and a shift to social conservatism. It was a period characterised by attempts to silence the voices of many people and make fear and negativity the currency of the day; a period where so-called choice for working people meant taking away their rights, new immigrants were placed in detention, indigenous people were marginalised, and crime was used as a weapon to drive through draconian laws. This was when I learnt about the politics of dishonesty. And the politics of fear.</p>
        <p class="a">I do not want those sorts of politics to emerge in New Zealand. I am in the Labour Party because it is committed to transparency, and it does have values of decency, fairness, and honesty at its core. I want to articulate a vision that is greater than one of individual aspiration. I do believe in aspiration, that all of us should have the best opportunities in life and be encouraged to get ahead. But getting ahead is not just about material wealth and not just about individuals. Doing well is about fulfilling your potential. But it is also about caring for the people around you, whether they are your family, your whānau, or your community. We are in this House today because we aspire. But I hope that it is not just aspiration for our own personal ambitions, that it is aspiration for all New Zealanders.</p>
        <p class="a">Above all, I believe in community. Community is at the heart of what Labour means. With strong communities, you have social cohesion. You have people feeling connected and settled, and being able to look outwards to what they can achieve. I believe in a society where children are at the core of all policy decisions, where addressing the causes of child poverty is at the forefront of all that we do. Children are our future. They need the best environment to grow up in, and strong, safe communities.</p>
        <a name="page_748"></a>
        <p class="a">I also care passionately about our country’s natural values and the importance of preserving them for the future. For me it is about the people and the planet. You cannot have one without the other, and it is the huge challenge of our time to reconcile the two.</p>
        <p class="a">It is a travesty that this Government does not consider it a priority to invest in a low-cost means to make houses warm and dry. I think of the houses where small children are constantly sick with asthma and other respiratory conditions. I think of the woman I spoke to on the doorstep of her uninsulated South Dunedin flat in midwinter who did not get out of bed before midday because she could not afford to heat her home. Her story is common across South Dunedin, and what a difference warm and dry houses would make to those people’s lives. In Dunedin there are 40,000 residential dwellings that were built before 1978 insulation standards, many of which need urgent attention. Under Labour, the billion-dollar energy efficiency fund, which has been canned by the National Government, would have assisted families to make their homes warmer, drier, and healthier, reduced their power bills, saved energy, and reduced carbon emissions. Numerous speakers in the House this week have referred to this critical issue. I ask all members to press for an investment in insulation and heating of housing across New Zealand. We have the means to do it. Do not ditch this policy.</p>
        <p class="a">And I believe that rail is an extremely important part of our future. It was the right decision to buy it back. I hope this Government will invest in KiwiRail, and acknowledge that integrated public transport is essential for economic growth and to reduce our carbon emissions. Getting more cars and trucks off roads is a public good.</p>
        <p class="a">I worked for 20 years in the communications industry. I started off as a journalist and moved into public relations. I have worked in Australia and New Zealand, largely in the private sector. I have run my own business for the last 6 years. I understand that small business is the backbone of our country. I also understand the importance of balance and fairness in the relationship between employers and employees to drive productivity. Introducing a law that allows employers to fire workers at will in the first 90 days is not about fairness; it is about exploitation and will create insecurity.</p>
        <p class="a">Instead of taking rights and protections away from ordinary people, we should create new opportunities. Let us use information technology to punch above our weight and drive economic growth. Already, 1.5 million New Zealanders are connected to the Internet, a third of our workforce does at least some work from home, and there are 200,000 home-based businesses. We need to pay more attention to building strong communities that provide people with better choices: the ability to work flexibly, to live in well-resourced communities with strong public transport links, and to live in good-quality housing.</p>
        <p class="a">Along with some other Labour colleagues I too support New Zealand becoming a republic, for us to become a truly independent nation. The time is right for a public conversation about this important issue.</p>
        <p class="a">And we urgently need to openly discuss the role of Government in our lives. National and ACT say less, not more, that the Government should get out of people’s lives, and that private sector investment is more important than State investment. Contrary to these views, I believe that most people look to the Government for stability, security, support, leadership, and action. And for strong public services.</p>
        <p class="a">The fifth Labour Government fulfilled those things and will be judged by history to have been a very good Government, a strong and wise Government. I pay tribute to two important people in this Parliament, and in the lives of all New Zealanders. Helen Clark is the role model for generations of New Zealanders. She embodies leadership, inner strength, courage, and determination. She has kept our party strong and placed New Zealand high on the international stage. Michael Cullen has made a huge contribution to our party’s thinking, and to the shape of our country. He is a finance Minister who took
 the tough calls and protected our future. His humour, sparkle, and eloquence are not matched in this Parliament.</p>
        <a name="page_749"></a>
        <p class="a">I look forward to serving under the able and energetic leadership of Phil Goff and Annette King, and to working with, and learning from, my caucus colleagues.</p>
        <p class="a">In closing, I pay tribute to my parents, Kinney and Shirley, who are here today; to my sisters, Judith and Katherine, who have always stood alongside me and from whom I draw inspiration; and to my little family. To Doug Lilly, my partner, my friend, we embarked on this journey together and I could not do it without you. My two boys, Callum and Riley Curran, you are the most important people in my life. You are the future. You are the reason I am here in this place, but your welfare will always be my first priority. I may be an MP, but I will always be your mum.</p>
        <p class="a">And, finally, I say to the people of Dunedin South that you will be my touchstone and my backbone. I will do my best to listen to you and involve you, and I endeavour to work with you to restore your faith in politics, strive to make opportunities for you to fulfil your potential, and strive to make our communities strong.</p>
        <p class="a">E aku rahi, e aku iti koutou i areare taringa mai ki tōku whaikupu tuatahi, tēnā koutou katoa. Ka huri.</p>

          <strong>CHRIS HIPKINS (Labour—Rimutaka)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong>Kia ora koutou katoa. E kui mā, e koro mā, e te whānau, ngā iwi o te motu, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa.</p>
        <p class="a">[<em>Greetings to you all. To you, the gracious men and womenfolk, the family, and the people of the land, greetings, greetings, and greetings to us all</em><strong></strong>.]</p>
        <p class="a">It is with tremendous pride and a great sense of responsibility that I rise almost for the first time as the new member of Parliament for Rimutaka. As a genuine Hutt boy I feel deeply honoured to have this opportunity to serve and represent the community that has given so much to me. My speech is notable at least in the sense that maiden speeches from my part of the country are reasonably infrequent events. In the last century the part of the Rimutaka electorate formerly known as Eastern Hutt elected just four members of Parliament—Sir Thomas Wilford, Sir Walter Nash, Trevor Young, and my immediate predecessor, Paul Swain. It is my sincere hope that the good people of Rimutaka will choose to continue this tradition of stability in the future and I will have many more opportunities to address this House.</p>
        <p class="a">This time 2 years ago I was just settling into a new life in London. Never did I imagine that 2 years later I would be standing in this House. My time living away from New Zealand gave me a much greater appreciation for all that I love about Aotearoa New Zealand. While I was away I missed the beaches, the mountains, and the forests, and I missed the unique diversity of cultures that makes us so special. There is nothing quite like watching an All Black haka in a cold and dreary London pub to make the hair stand up on the back of your neck and your heart call out for home. Living and travelling throughout the UK and Europe also gave me an insight into things that I think we could do much better here at home. As a backpacker I made it right around the Continent by train, by bus, and on foot, and it made me realise just how far we have to go before we live up to our own propaganda about being a truly sustainable nation.</p>
        <p class="a">Since arriving back home in New Zealand I have made a point of catching the train to work whenever possible, and cycling where I can. The residents of the Hutt Valley are keen users of public transport, but we have a long way to go before we make it a truly world-class service. Anyone who has tried to bike from Upper Hutt to Wellington during peak-hour traffic will also know that we have a way to go in regard to cycle safety. I am aware that there is active discussion about improving the cycleway between Pētone and Ngauranga, and I believe that we need to progress that with some haste.</p>
        <a name="page_750"></a>
        <p class="a">In many ways the Rimutaka electorate embodies the rich diversity that I love about New Zealand. The Hutt Valley is home to a wide range of cultures, ethnicities, and families with a wide variety of economic means. Our rolling green hills and fresh clean river represent the wonderful natural environment we take for granted throughout the country. There is no place I would rather call home and no place that I am prouder to represent in this Parliament than the Hutt Valley.</p>
        <p class="a">I acknowledge all of those who have come before us. Standing in this House we do indeed stand on the shoulders of giants. I acknowledge two giants of the Labour Party here in the House today, Helen Clark and Michael Cullen—I wrote that before I realised I was going to be standing next to you. For the past decade they have led our country with great strength and dignity, and I honour their lifelong commitment to making New Zealand a better place. I believe that the fifth Labour Government will be remembered for restoring the balance between our right to individual freedoms and our responsibilities to one another as members of society.</p>
        <p class="a">It will be remembered for ensuring that the needs of the competitive free market are balanced by the need for the Government to set a few boundaries and ensure that the most vulnerable are protected. The past weeks and months of economic turmoil have demonstrated very clearly that the great promise of humanity will never be realised if we leave our most vulnerable exposed and unprotected in cruel economic winds. We will never live in a truly harmonious and prosperous society unless we turn our backs on the “What’s in it for me?” mantra of individualism that pervaded our public policy decision-making for much of the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
        <p class="a">Growing up in the Hutt Valley during the 1980s I saw, first hand, the impact the great rolling back of the State had on many of our families. Many of the kids I went to school with had parents who had worked in the public services and found themselves on the economic scrap heap, thanks to Rogernomics. Those parents struggled to provide their kids with the basics in life. Their problems were compounded when what little financial support they did receive was cut by the incoming National Government in its now infamous “mother of all Budgets”. Like mine, they were loving parents who wanted the best for their kids. I utterly reject the notion that they could have got ahead, if only they had worked harder. They had no jobs, and there were no jobs to get. In many cases they had only minimal skills and qualifications and there was no support available to gain any. As a society, we simply turned our backs on them.</p>
        <p class="a">We live with the legacy of that action today. Those tough economic times created a huge divide between those in our country who have, and those who have not. The result was a breakdown in our collective community spirit. As a society, we became indifferent to the lives of those around us. We see that indifference to others in the terrible growth in violent crime. We see it in the tragic level of child abuse that goes unreported, until it is too late. We see it in the graffiti and vandalism that has invaded our public spaces. We cannot solve these problems by turning away from them, and we cannot solve these problems by pretending they are someone else’s responsibility.</p>
        <p class="a">I believe that a major challenge for this and future generations will be rediscovering our sense of community spirit and responsibility. We need to rediscover our faith in collective institutions and processes. I too am ambitious for New Zealand but the prosperity that I dream of will not be measured by the size of our cars or the number of holiday homes we own. It will be measured by the strength of our compassion towards one another. It will be measured by the collective efforts that we take to give our kids the best possible start in life. It will be measured by the respect we show to our older citizens. It will be measured by the steps we take to help each other up the ladder of opportunity. We need to move past the notion that our welfare system should be little more than a safety net at the bottom of that ladder. It can and it should help people up. I
 have little time for those who, having climbed that ladder themselves, think it is their right to pull it up behind them.</p>
        <a name="page_751"></a>
        <p class="a">We need to look very carefully at the support available to our families and recognise the tremendous importance of families and whānau in all of our lives. I would not be standing here today were it not for the love and support I received from my parents, Rose and Doug, who are sitting in the gallery this afternoon. They are joined by many of the wider whānau, the friends and family who have supported me throughout my life and helped me realise all of the opportunities that are available to me. I recognise that my success in life, and my ability to grasp the opportunities in front of me, is as much a tribute to the love and support I have received from those around me as it is to my own individual efforts.</p>
        <p class="a">I carry with me the values that my parents taught my brother Dave and I, and, hopefully, at some point he will be watching this speech on the Internet in Dublin. They taught us to place ourselves in the shoes of others and treat them as we would like to be treated ourselves. They encouraged us to measure ourselves not just by our own happiness, but by the happiness that we bring to others. Growing up, I never considered myself a rich kid, but my brother and I were raised with an abundant supply of love and support, and there can be no greater wealth than that. Our parents were always there when we needed them and they gave us all of the time that we needed. I do sometimes wonder whether the overwhelming emphasis we place today on paid work is undermining the importance of family time. How many of our social problems that we face today would be overcome if only we took a little more time for family and for those around us? Perhaps the people in my Rimutaka electorate would stop worrying about the significant growth in the size of Rimutaka Prison if we started measuring our response to crime by the steps we take to prevent it in the first place, rather than by the number of people whom we lock up after the event.</p>
        <p class="a">Too often we are asking our social institutions to compensate for the breakdown in our family lives and in our social networks. The education system is a classic example. I recognise the critical role of social workers in our schools, but also I recognise they are the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff, not the fence at the top. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the thousands of dedicated teachers we have in our schools. They carry an incredible responsibility and it is all too easy when debating education to resort to a “blame the teacher” mentality. There may be some teachers who could do better, but I believe that the vast majority of our teachers are dedicated and hard-working, and they quite literally change lives.</p>
        <p class="a">I believe that we need to rethink the competitive model of schooling that was introduced through Tomorrow’s Schools. When schools compete, the real losers are the students who have no other option than to attend the poorer performing schools. They are often from poorer families, are frequently brown, and sadly they often do not enjoy the same level of support at home that others in more affluent areas do. If we are to ensure that Kiwi kids get the best possible chances in education, we need to ensure that every school is a great school and every teacher is a great teacher. We can start by looking very carefully at the physical learning environment in our schools and the level of resourcing that they have available.</p>
        <p class="a">The state of Upper Hutt’s State intermediate and secondary schools was a major issue during the recent election campaign. One of my priorities over the next 3 years will be ensuring those schools get the $30 million in additional funding they were promised. Like so many throughout the country, those four schools are trying to make do with old facilities, built for the schooling needs of the 1960s and the 1970s. They are no longer fit for purpose. I visited most of the schools in the Rimutaka electorate over the past year and I know that most of them are struggling to provide their teachers and
 students with the learning resources they need, given the level of funding they have available.</p>
        <a name="page_752"></a>
        <p class="a">We need to recognise that technology has changed our school system dramatically in the past decade, but, unfortunately, the funding system has not kept up. If we are to realise our full potential as a nation in the coming decades, education will be critical, and it will not just be in the school system. At this point I would like to acknowledge our new Speaker, the Hon Dr Lockwood Smith, and the vision of a seamless, lifelong education that he articulated during his time as Minister of Education. I believe it was the right vision then, and it remains the right vision now.</p>
        <p class="a">It is perhaps somewhat ironic that it was whilst protesting the last National Government’s policies in tertiary education that I became actively involved in politics at a national level. Following a protest march to Parliament I found myself enjoying Her Majesty’s hospitality at the Wellington Central Police Station. Eleven years after being forcibly removed from the grounds of Parliament, I find myself back on the inside, although in a very different sense. Having experienced parliamentary urgency for the first time last week, I can say the feeling of containment is very similar, although the surroundings certainly superior.</p>
        <p class="a">I remain as committed today as I was 11 years ago to breaking down the barriers to participation in higher education. I am incredibly proud of all that has been achieved over the past 9 years, from putting an end to the massive tuition fee increases to the introduction of interest-free student loans. I am deeply disappointed we are one election victory away from achieving a universal living allowance for students.</p>
        <p class="a">However, we also need to recognise that in a modern economy a great deal more learning is going to be taking place in non-institutional settings. The time I spent working in the industry training field convinced me of the enormous value and potential of on-the-job learning. We need to do more to ensure that is adequately supported. In particular, I believe we need to look very closely at the level of support we provide to small employers who take on apprentices. Many of the people living in the Rimutaka electorate are former employees of large manufacturers such as General Motors or South Pacific Tyres, or of the former large Government departments such as the Post Office or the railways. Those organisations were much more than just large employers; they were also places of learning. They trained many of the tradespeople whom we have in our workforce today.</p>
        <p class="a">As increasing numbers of those people are nearing retirement age, we will need to find new ways of ensuring that their skills are passed on to new generations. In fact, I would go as far as to say that the retirement of the baby-boomer generation will be one of the biggest challenges we are going to face over the coming decade. In recent years we have seen a considerable growth in the number of rest homes and retirement villages in the Hutt Valley, and with half a million New Zealanders nearing retirement age, that trend will only continue. I firmly believe that the care of our older citizens is far too important to leave to the vagaries of the free market. I find it morally repugnant that the assets older citizens have spent a lifetime accumulating can be scooped up in a few short years and added to the profit margins of large corporate conglomerates. Older citizens deserve so much better.</p>
        <p class="a">To paraphrase former US Vice-President Hubert Humphrey, the moral test of a Government is how that Government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick and the needy. As our world grows ever more complex and demanding, reconnecting with each other will be one of the great challenges of the 21st century. We have never been more mobile than we are today, yet we have never had higher rates of loneliness and depression. Technology connects us with friends and
 family across the globe, yet we have never been less likely to know the names of our own next-door neighbours. We need to reignite the fire of our collective spirit; we need to rediscover what it means to live as part of a community. Compassion, respect, friendship, love, tolerance, and forgiveness need once again to become values embedded in all that we do.</p>
        <a name="page_753"></a>
        <p class="a">I thank the people of the Rimutaka electorate who have given me this opportunity to serve. Particular thanks go to the Rimutaka Labour campaign team: George and Josephine Collins, John and Anna Young, Janette Granville, Bill Werry, Julie Englebretsen, Ian Dunwoodie, Claire Norris, and Jan Smith. It was a long and exhausting campaign, but you rose to the challenge. I thank my family, and all those others who have supported me along this journey. I hope I live up to your expectations.

          <strong>JACINDA ARDERN (Labour)</strong>
          <strong>:</strong> Mr Assistant Speaker, I am honoured to stand in this House today, and I join my colleagues who have gone before me in congratulating you on your election as Assistant Speaker. Maiden statements are a bit like words spoken in a heated argument; like it or not, they will come back to haunt one. Today I will share with members the words that I wish to haunt me: my values and beliefs, and the things that have brought me here. I do so in the hope that should I ever abandon them, I will have the good grace to leave. But I cannot begin without first paying tribute to the previous leader of the Labour Party, Helen Clark. There are many reasons why I joined the Labour Party, but it was Helen who made me proud to be a member. My generation grew up under Helen’s leadership and many do not know how good they had it. I have no doubt that her leadership will leave a legacy well beyond my own generation.</p>
        <p class="a">I cannot pinpoint exactly when my interest in politics began, but I know it began when I was young. I was born in Hamilton, but in the 1980s my family relocated to Murupara, where my father took up the role of the local police sergeant. My memories of that place are vivid. I knew that a lot of people had lost their jobs, but I did not understand that it was due to the privatisation of the forestry industry and to a complete lack of central government support. I knew that there were suicides, and that the girl who used to babysit my sister and me one day turned yellow from hepatitis and could not visit us any more. But I did not understand the linkages between these things and the poverty of the community I was living in.</p>
        <p class="a">My passion for social justice came from what I saw; my love of politics came when I realised that it was the key to changing what I saw. And there is much to change.</p>
        <p class="a">The fifth Labour Government made good progress on what I believe must continue to be our focus—reducing poverty in this country. Labour has ensured that no elderly person lives below the poverty line, but that does not mean that many do not still live a very hard life.</p>
        <p class="a">Labour lifted 130,000 children out of poverty through Working for Families, but that does not mean that many do not remain there still. I will not pretend that the response is simple; it is not. The majority of children living in poverty now are dependants in families where the main means of support is a Government benefit. But if we believe that our welfare State is a necessary safety net and a support for those unable to support themselves—as I do—then the children living in these circumstances should not be living in poverty. These children are not part of an underclass, as I have heard them called; they are part of our community, and we have a responsibility to continue the momentum of the previous Labour Government and to finally rid ourselves of poverty in Aotearoa New Zealand. This is our collective challenge.</p>
        <a name="page_754"></a>
        <p class="a">Murupara and the wonderful people who live there, and who continue to work hard to rejuvenate their community, formed just one of the many lessons I have learnt. Demonstrating my parent’s absolute love of big cities, my family relocated to Morrinsville. I have very good memories of growing up in this small rural Waikato town. It is a key productive region of New Zealand, and is the region of my family. My grandfather dug the drains there, my other grandfather farmed there, and I had the privilege of campaigning there in the last election. It is a place that keeps me grounded.</p>
        <p class="a">I attended Morrinsville College, which is a fantastic school and an example of why we should be proud of our public education system and the teachers working within it. I only wish that my education could have extended to the universal teaching of te reo Māori, so that more of my generation could converse in our national language rather than in the more common offering of German, French, and Japanese. Education in language builds understanding. I join colleagues who have gone before me in calling for the universal and compulsory teaching of te reo in our schools, and for all of the necessary resource that goes with it.</p>
        <p class="a">Morrinsville College was also the place where I experienced my first election, campaigning on the weighty electoral issue that girls should be allowed to wear trousers to school. I was elected to the Morrinsville College board of trustees and was subsequently appointed to the suspension committee as the student representative. It was tough. I sat face to face with my peers who were facing removal from the education system. Although I had no qualms about handing down punishment to those students who were bullies in our school, I also saw many come before us who quite clearly had no emotional or financial support from their families, from their caregivers, or from their community.</p>
        <p class="a">So much lies in our beginnings. Research tells us that young people who find themselves in front of the criminal justice system have also experienced instability in their homes. They have witnessed violence, and three out of four are likely to have grown up in families that did not have enough to get by. We will never find durable solutions that genuinely prevent issues like disengagement in education right through to entry into the criminal justice system if we continue to look at the shallow end of the problem.</p>
        <p class="a">Morrinsville brought with it other experiences. When I was 14 I got my first job, at a fish and chip shop, and eventually I ended up at a grocery store, as a number of my colleagues have done. It was the 1990s. I earned roughly $5 an hour, I joined a union that struggled to support us under the realities of the Employment Contracts Act, and I saw the real consequences of working for a hostile management team.</p>
        <p class="a">I saw the importance of unions again in 2005 when, on a whim, I packed my bags and moved to New York. While I struggled to find work I volunteered in a soup kitchen and on a campaign for home-care workers who had been without an employment contract for over a decade. I busied myself as a campaign assistant—coming up with chants that sounded fine in a Kiwi accent, but never sounded quite right when belted out by Americans—and I organised the workers. Their very presence on that picket line threatened their livelihood. It was an experience that deepened my commitment to having a balance in employment relationships—a balance that I was shocked to see so severely disrupted in my very first week in this House.</p>
        <p class="a">I have never given up on finding new ways to change what was going on around me, but I am the first to concede that I am not a normal young person. At this election young people made up 50 percent of those who did not bother to enrol. They are in the age group that is least likely to vote but is most likely to be affected by the decisions we make here.</p>
        <a name="page_755"></a>
        <p class="a">I have the privilege of holding the youth affairs portfolio. There are many issues within this role—health, education, justice. However, it cannot be just about speaking on behalf of young people but also about giving them the opportunity and reason to speak for themselves. Like many who have gone before me, I too believe that civic education plays a massive role in doing this. But so does the simple impact of our example. We all have the responsibility to help restore a little faith in our political processes, to continually show the relevance of politics to young people and the wider community, and to find new and better ways of listening and responding. Some may call this participatory democracy; I just call it our job.</p>
        <p class="a">One of my first opportunities to see all sides of a member of Parliament’s role was when I took a job in Phil Goff’s office. It was an honour to work for Phil. I saw at first hand just how hard he is prepared to work for New Zealanders and his commitment to them, and I am very honoured to work with him once more.</p>
        <p class="a">Like so many Kiwis, I also took the opportunity to travel abroad. I studied at Arizona State University for a semester. Midway through my time there two planes flew into the World Trade Center and everything around me changed. I have watched as international politics has continued to change while serving as the president of the International Union of Socialist Youth—an umbrella organisation of over 150 progressive youth movements from around the world. This role has sent me to some far-flung places around the globe, from Bhutanese refugee camps to the people of Western Sahara, to Lebanon, and to Jerusalem and the West Bank and the wall that divides the two.</p>
        <p class="a">Some people have asked me whether I am a radical. My answer to that question is very simple: “I am from Morrinsville.” Where I come from a radical is someone who chooses to drive a Toyota rather than a Holden or a Ford. I am, though, a social democrat. I believe in what I believe strongly—the values of human rights, social justice, equality, and democracy, and the role of communities—and I believe we have a role to play in defending these principles abroad. Anyone who has moved abroad will know what it is like to reflect on one’s home from afar, and I have always done so with pride; not just for our position on foreign affairs but also for our thriving music and film industry, our culture and our heritage, and our country’s beauty. But these things do not merely exist. They must be fostered and must be protected, and with more than empty rhetoric.</p>
        <p class="a">I fear that our pride in New Zealand’s clean, green reputation is already misplaced. It is shameful enough that we are about to lose New Zealand’s most proactive legislation in response to the impacts of climate change that we have seen to date. It is unspeakable that, in addition, we now have a parliamentary select committee to question the science of climate change itself. We had the potential to be a world leader. National told us we should be fast followers, but now all I see are the many, many losers—the future generations whom some people in this House do not yet believe they have a responsibility to. Well, I do.</p>
        <p class="a">There are other things that time spent working in an international environment can teach you. I spent 3 years in the United Kingdom working as a public servant—a career I have a great amount of respect for. This role took me from the UK Cabinet Office to the Department for Business and Enterprise, where I was an assistant director working on regulatory issues. I spent most of my time—this is probably a shock to members on the other side of the House—talking to small businesses, local authorities, and even police officers, trying to understand the delicate balancing act between creating a regulatory environment that protects citizens whilst also allowing business and public services to flourish. I am very mindful of the importance and the need for both. With a strong economy comes the chance to further strengthen public services and create a fairer society for everyone.</p>
        <a name="page_756"></a>
        <p class="a">But personal experiences are only a very small part of the thing that brings you to a place, and I have to acknowledge the role of my family. My parents have always challenged me and supported me. They have shown me that the world is not black and white, nor is it rose-tinted, and I honour them. I honour my mother, who gave up everything for her girls in an era where choices were made between family and career. I honour my father for his dedication to his family and to the New Zealand Police for the past 35 years. He has seen the most horrific side of human nature, but has always shown compassion and a commitment to building communities in New Zealand and now in Niue. And to my dear sister, Louise, I say that nothing bores her more than politics, which is why her support has meant so very much to me.</p>
        <p class="a">But apart from my dear Auntie Ann, it was my nana who was the true political beast in my family. Gladys was staunch Labour. Sadly, I never had the opportunity to ask her what made her so passionate that she would switch off the TV if Muldoon ever came on, and would leave it off for at least 10 minutes to make sure he was not polluting her screen any longer. I know that I can do no better than to make Gladys, Harry, and Annie proud.</p>
        <p class="a">To my Waikato campaign team, including my wonderful grandparents, who fought hard alongside me in a seat that has been held by National for the past 40 years, I say that next time we will take it on the specials. To all my friends and to the new and existing Labour team; to Darren, for all the leave that I know he will grant me and for dispensing the kind of advice that proves he was born middle-aged but also that he was born wise; to Marian Hobbs, the old conscience of this House; and to Michael—I am proud to be the youngest member of this Parliament but even prouder to serve here with him as the father of this House—I thank them all.</p>
        <p class="a">So there it is: the answer to that golden question. It is the things I have seen, the lessons I have learnt, and the people of New Zealand whom I wish to serve that have brought me to this place. These are the very things that I wish to haunt me for as long as I have the privilege of serving here. Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa.</p>
